Some of the technical indicators are looking pretty precarious for smallcaps, but the whole thing looks like pretty classic ‘risk off.’ Growth stocks and small caps are selling off while safe haven assets like bonds are gaining.

It’s not entirely clear what prompted this move. Lots of noise on that front. Not seeing any particularly convincing arguments either.

On the line was Ryan Cohen, the billionaire co-founder and former chief executive of online pet supplies retailer Chewy who is now leading GameStop's push into e-commerce. Cohen was responding to an email Titus had sent 12 hours earlier to more than two dozen GameStop executives and board members.

""NOBODY has attempted to respond except a muddled voicemail with no distinguishable callback number or extension. E-commerce requires a customer support team and processes that are responsive,"" Titus wrote.

GameStop earnings after the close could provide a welcome respite for all this Fed talk. Will let you guys deal with that here.

Other than that it’s all about the Fed. We do also have Treasury Secretary (and former Fed chair) Janet Yellen testifying alongside Powell today. That testimony has already been released and it sounds like a marketing pitch for the Biden administration, as would be expected.

Not sure if the Treasury Secretary will take questions from lawmakers. Not sure it will matter. Powell stuck to his script yesterday, as expected. Bonds rallied a bit on this news.

We’re left with a market looking like it’s still very much struggling for direction. Not sure how much sense that makes considering what’s going on with the big picture — reopening and vaccines, etc. Maybe it’s concerns about the coronavirus variants or the efficacy of the vaccines. But those have been with us for more than a year and overall it’s hard to see how the situation looks worse now than then."	70

Lost the 13k from nio gambling on options. Told myself I still had 17k can get it back easy.

17k->7k->0... 6 month break.

&#x200B;

Past 3 months: -15k (kept dumping my checks in)... For every big winner who is retiring on wsb theres gotta be a 100 of us going bankrupt. 

I spent my funds on gambling in the part rather than improving personal life, it'll take me a year to recover from the debts im currently in (was gamblign instead of paying bills). Hope to keep the house, have to call them to work something out. My only play now is to leave my cushy job for a higher paying one that will likely be stressful.

Mass reports on accounts posting DD to get them suspended

Shills are fighting back!!

Moderators and respected users from the GeEmEe sub reddit that provide the people with good due diligence are being targeted en mass with account claims, to the point that Reddit suspends their accounts. If this is not a sign that they are still more then afraid of the retail side shoot me. It looks like that, in a last ditch effort, next to mass downvoting, they are now also directly targeting those who are informing the public. Taking away freedom of speech, combined with creating media silences when they want to and negative media sentiment when they need to, this is really going of the charts and they are fully living up to Cramer’s acknowledgement that, when you are wrong, do everything in your power to hide that.

Portnoy has his bad ideas out loud. Portnoy was also buddies with our deposed founder. The second he finds out about nerdcoins he has the idea to pump and dump them on his own audience. Mark Cuban showed up in /r/wallstreetbets (at the request of former scammer mods) to shill NFTs and decentralization too.

Weird huh? Remember this. It'll probably become clear within the next week or two why I'm starting to show you more of the truth of what happened. I offered the story to vice and others and they wouldn't commit to not including some scam crypto pitch, so I know which side they're on.

The above should make it less weirdly random and more suspicious that the Winklevii and Cuban were featured in GameStopped, or that the legacy media can't stop interviewing our deposed founder and showering him in money, deals, etc, despite literally being removed for scamming and also [harvesting emails to sell to scammers](https://i.gyazo.com/9e5589650d194d58e0638477b677f1a5.png) before being kicked out.

If you are genuinely selling large amounts of shares, you would do it gently and carefully. This sort of dumping is for one reason Ans one reason alone. 

They are betting people will get tired, and drop the shares.

If you do this, they can still win.

However, if you dont.... And lets say buy more at the dips. OR keep holding. The price will come up again very quickly in a few days.

gr42ney	Just a friendly reminder to anyone who doesn’t already know what’s going on.  Look at the age of every account who’s been spreading negativity.  Look at their post history, shills.  Enough said, ignore the bs and do what we do.  Hold. The fucking. LINE.	43	
gr43a1d	GME on sale 🙌🏽💎 I love it	37	
gr5i5py	Told my wife we make too much money to get the stimulus this time so now she gets to brag to her friends about how rich we are and i get 2800 dollars to bet on stocks that went +300% over the course of a week.	39	
gr3wl9k	Imagine writing off GME before it’s earnings call next week. If a tweet from RC can cause the stock to rally what do you think hearing him speak will do?	39	
gr3zoob	Love the haters only come out when gme is red	37	
gr41bky	Tons of hate in here today. We’ve seen this happen how many times now? 4? 5x? We hold, we win, we apes	36	
gr41v3d	Lmao, all the salty apes that didn’t buy into GME are now throwing shade @ GME because $F & S&P have gone up. Sorry y’all didn’t buy in for the moon ride 🤣🚀💎🍌 GME ALL THE WAY BABY ❤️	37	
gr448ca	If you're still bitching and moaning about the price of GME, you clearly still have no idea what is going on 😂	36	
gr451u0	Don’t be delusional. If you think GME is going down than sell, and buy back later when you feel like it’s hit bottom. Don’t be a retarded fuck who listens to these clowns with 1-2 shares who NEEDS it to go to 1k+ before they can cash in. Take your profits, hold cash, buy back when it’s steady. I sold, at 271 yesterday, because I could see it going down. Am I buying back in? Absolutely when the bleeding has stopped. Would I gain anything by holding? Absolutely fucking not. Instead of holding 20 shares I might be able to hold 40 next time because I sold out early with a profit. And maybe when it moons, I might be holding 40 shares instead of the 20 I had.	38	
gr454us	Don't forget to sell the dip and fomo back in when it's higher than your previous sell price, wsb tradition is important	36	
gr4vv97	If AMC hits $15 my wife said we can try anal. She’s 7” long but I think I can handle it.	38	
gr3xj47	[deleted]	36	
gr3yxzn	I don't get why people are freaking out so much with GME, we are still +10% in the week, +320% in the month and +1630% 3-months, I see nothing bad here, just stabilization before take-off	34	
gr3zdav	BB got some good news yesterday. So I’m expecting some pretty hard sideways trading all week.	39	
gr457gr	The amount of work I get done in a day is inversely related to the GME stock price.	40	
gr183zf	"Hey I've been taking your ~~complaints~~ feedback into account, I lowered the threshold for the meme culling a bit.

Just trying to strike a good balance between content and not having meme spam.

If successful I will repost the video as a main thread for you to relish my slap head.
