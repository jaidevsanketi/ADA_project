gw1neow	I have no idea what MVIS will do, but these idiots who didn't make any money and don't have puts just want it to tank so they feel better about being a pussy. Everybody wins and losses you cucks. Your rooting for a loss because your Vagina hurts. Probably all bagholding SNDL.	33

gw1piud	I don’t know what I’m doing.	33	
gw1r4v3	So who else is watching MNMD with me at 5.7	29	
gw1r90w	"I'd love to see companies like MNMD thrive, partially because I own a few shares, but mostly because of the major improvements in treatment for all my homies with PTSD. That shit is no joke, but MDMA and other hallucinogenics have been shown to directly target the areas of the brain that PTSD affects. I just wanna see my boys standing as tall as they are strong.

Edit: thanks for award! Write to whatever representatives you can to push towards enabling these kinds of treatments and making them accessible. Same with Marijuana. People shouldn't have to self medicate at risk of prison time. Everyone deserves to be their best self."	35	
gw1swys	Ok MNMD now you’re just being silly, come back up here you goof	35	
gw1tzjb	MindMed bouncing back 10% after the halt. I gotta quit reading this thread. You FUDpuckers stress me out.	33

gw2gpoj	if you had over 200% gains yesterday and didn't sell and kept adding more and held an unprofitable meme stock that was already up over a 100% in the last two days, then well you just got what you deserved. Take profits, kids.	35	
gw2k0sk	"This sub has become nothing more than dumbass teenagers buying dog shit meme stocks at their peak and then desperately spamming the threads to get more people to either buy or keep holding so they can recoup their losses.

gw2z5dv	I am the worst trader in the history or traders	29	
gw31kvx	Why the fuck did I buy MNMD hate you all	25	
gw197vx	So is MVIS the distraction from GME or is GME the distraction from MVIS? Or are they both distractions from AMC? Or are they all distractions, or possibly none of them distractions? Maybe, just maybe they are all just stocks. Or conspiracies. Or both. So many questions.	26	
gw1wnpr	#show me that MVIS loss porn	27	
gw1xz4t	Why the fuck is everyone surprised when a stock that's up 200% in four trading days goes down on the fifth? The fuck is up with this buy and hold culture? Anybody that tells you not to take profit is trying to get you to hold their bags.	29

100% profits."	32	
gw1v182	"I feel bad for anybody that saw all the MVIS comments these past few days and decided to hop in after it already rocketed. A LOT of those bullish MVIS comments were made by bots or purchased accounts. Found a few yesterday myself. 

One account had 15+ bullish MVIS comments just yesterday and yet prior to yesterday the account hadn’t commented for over a year, and the only comments the account had from a year ago were military related and there were only like 7 comments. 

Be careful out there boys"	28	
gw1vxp1	PSA: Anyone telling you to hold or buy more just wants you to drive the price back up so they can sell for a better price. They don't give a fuck about your account.	26	
gw1ws9s	MNMD is absolutely going back up	28

1. **There is no news**
2. **There are over 600K shares available to borrow, in Fidelity alone, with only 0.75% interest rate**
3. **The volume is not even 15% of the free float**
4. **Open interest for puts expiring this Friday is 3.7 times larger than calls that means gamma squeeze is not even a remote probability.**

Let me tell you why, because they know you will buy far OTM calls the moment you see a 5-6% spike and then they will slowly bleed the SP in next trading days to kill those calls (and also puts). I said this long ago, this will keep repeating many more times.

Go ahead and start downvoting!"	34

gvljr2m	"I've been AFK for a bit from the modchat and discord. They uncovered evidence that they're pretty sure makes MVIS a pump, something about emails being sent around from which DD is being copy+pasted here or something, and brigading. Idk the specifics, I'm out of the loop.

It turns out they were blocking that ticker sporadically yesterday (via automod) while trying to figure out what to do. Personally I think the right move would have been publicly saying something **first** then blocking it **second**, but I wasn't involved in the decision. I had about as much information as any of you had about it up until twenty minutes ago, which is a problem because how were you supposed to know why it was happening if I didn't either?

So no, my bots are not to blame. WSB is not fuk. It is not some nefarious conspiracy. It is not *hedge fund shilling*. The mods are not on the take. They're not pumping MVIS, they're not dumping MVIS. It has no relation to GME. It's just people being shortsighted and trying to do the right thing. Sorry for technically lying to a bunch of people yesterday saying ""omg we don't block MVIS"". **That part bothers me the most.**

I'm not trying to throw anyone under the bus, those dudes are my homies, I'm trying to stop the entire community from getting thrown under the bus by decent decisions made with terrible optics/implementation. We've already got enough conspiracy theory stuff being leveled at us without giving them more ammo by doing the right thing the wrong way. We very rarely block any ticker because.. y'know.. people thought GME was a pump too since people liked it. Just how it is. I can't even think of the last ticker we blocked.

EDIT: To be clear, I have no idea if MVIS will be considered spam or not, but that's what's been going on. And most of these angry replies are from people with a ton of history in the MVIS subreddit, which is kind of a problem in itself that I don't know how to handle.

**EDIT 2:** The issue isn't settled FYI. They're talking about it, I expect you'll either see what they considered when making the call yesterday or have it unblocked. I think if we're gonna do something like this what we have to show for it should withstand public scrutiny. We'll try to do it that way going forward."	188

We're likely to see another big rotation wave if the 10 year breaks out and attempts a run at 2+%.

Worth keeping an eye on imo since everything is correlated here.

There was a very clear reversal in the reopening trade, with pandemic-sensitive names like travel companies seeing most of the selling, while stay-at-home stocks like Costco and Clorox benefited. 

One pandemic winner that didn’t go along for this ride was Netflix, which reported a slowdown in subscriber growth. NFLX is being punished, down to almost $500 per share. We did have earnings beats from Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble, and JNJ. 

PNG and Coke said they were raising prices, which means inflation is a-coming (or is already here). But then the bond market doesn’t really seem to care. Maybe it’s already priced in.

Bottom line: The pandemic fears have not been able to generate much staying power since last April. We’ve seen this movie before and it always turns into a buying opportunity. Will this time be different? 

The macro elements that drive economies — interest rates, employment, real estate — are all pointing in the right direction. The Fed may be forced to act but we aren’t there yet. Big picture virus trends are pointing the right way too, at least in the U.S. and most developed markets.

Fear sells. Often people buy it. That’s where there are opportunities."	24

Great for high intensity sprints, but this leads to small kids, animals, and toys getting sucked underneath the treadmill.

Somehow, the people that got in and got out of GME... just cant handle the fact that others still think there is value in that play.

gulanjg	"Futures are pointing higher this morning, with small caps seeing the biggest gains. Russell 2000 up 0.9%. Nasdaq is 0.6% higher. Dow and S&P up 0.5%. That’s as of 0630.

It’s all about earnings today. This a day after Goldman, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo beat estimates. As I write this, Bank of America, PepsiCo, and UnitedHealth all came in and all beat on EPS and revenues. BlackRock also just reported and was the one outlier, beating on revenues but falling slightly short on EPS.

Still waiting on Charles Schwab, Citigroup, and U.S. Bancorp to round out the banks, but it looks like those ambitious earnings estimates were not misplaced.

Delta Air will report during market hours. That should be interesting where the reopening trend is concerned.

On the data front, we have retail sales and industrial production out this morning. And of course initial jobless claims seeing how it’s Thursday.

Bottom line: Things are looking pretty good for risk assets. Concerns about JNJ’s vaccine have faded. The reopening trend remains in force, at least in the U.S."	30

gumfq54	"I'm officially out for 90 days after being really stupid yesterday and taking 30k to 15k by FUD around tesla and constantly paperhanding stuff and switching calls/puts.

I am actually going to a therapist about my trading because it got so bad this last month.  Scheduled for 2 weeks from now.


I was up bigly (over 100k - I managed to be someone who had bought GME below 30).  Made money on PLUG, AAL, CCIV, apha, sndl (all the things.)

Then I bought into some other meme stocks (sndl, zom, ocgn, pltr) and this last month had me feeling like I needed to ""make it back"".

I had originally just made patient plays starting last March and that the reason I was up at all. Got lucky on some stuff but didn't fuck with day trades.

This last month I epically fucked myself feeling like I had to get back what I lost.  It became an addiction.  Constantly on Ameritrade, wsb, reading news around my stocks.  Not working, feeling sick, not eating, not working out, not spending time productive or relaxing at all.

As soon as insaw any red in my portfolio I'd freak out feeling like ""oh no I have to fix that."" Even though there was no emergency.  

The worst part is I effectively had 2 stupid days where if I had done nothing I still would have been green on the week. But between just those two days I day traded myself to 40k losses.  I consistently chose fear and emotion over the plan I had set out and couldn't control myself.

I constantly feel like I have to fix it and the only way to fix it is to trade. 

It was really fucking with all aspects of my life.  I'd be happy some days, and completely void of emotion others.  

Since I began trading I'm now down 10k overall.  

Hopefully I can work through my shit- this has been all I do every day for months now.  Stare at the chart.  Get emotional. Have no desire to do anything else.  Make bad emotional decisions after making good logical ones only to erase all gains made over weeks in a matter of minutes.


I consider myself lucky I didn't use the margin available and really fuck myself.  -10k suck, but I know others are worse off.

Maybe I'll never return to trading but I'll keep lurking and commenting.  I love this community, even the gay bears, for all the simultaneous support and shifting on people like me fir their terrible decisions."	30

gulnb88	"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Things are looking bright and sunny today.

* Companies are smashing earnings expectations across the board
* Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000.
* [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**. 

That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.

*[I try to predict the NASDAQ every day. See past prediction results and visualizations here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/yEPBC)*"	20

Mr Powell: ""We are definitely happy with the results so far but we are still a long way to go from where we want to be before we can consider ending QE or raising rates. The reality is, unemployment is still above 0%, cancer is still around, and the sky is still blue. What we are looking for is negative unemployment, and what we mean by this is we want people to hold multiple jobs. We want cancer to be eliminated. And finally, we want the sky to become green. Once we achieve these goals, we will consider raising rates and possible taper QE."""	20

When I was a kid back in 04 or 05, my dad asked me if I were to buy any one stonk, which would it be? I told him NVDA only because I loved playing video games and he had just gotten me a new Nvidia graphics card and I was stoked to be able to play Counter Strike with good FPS.

He said he'd get 500. In my head, I thought he got $500 worth. I completely forgot about it for about the last 15 or so years. Yesterday I called him and asked ""Hey remember when you bought $500 worth of Nvidia stock? It's probably worth like 40 grand now if you're still holding it!"" 

He said he was still holding, but made one correction. He didn't buy $500 worth, he bought 500 shares, and it's now worth over $300k.
