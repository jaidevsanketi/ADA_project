gw1r90w	"I'd love to see companies like MNMD thrive, partially because I own a few shares, but mostly because of the major improvements in treatment for all my homies with PTSD. That shit is no joke, but MDMA and other hallucinogenics have been shown to directly target the areas of the brain that PTSD affects. I just wanna see my boys standing as tall as they are strong.

Edit: thanks for award! Write to whatever representatives you can to push towards enabling these kinds of treatments and making them accessible. Same with Marijuana. People shouldn't have to self medicate at risk of prison time. Everyone deserves to be their best self."	35

gw2gpoj	if you had over 200% gains yesterday and didn't sell and kept adding more and held an unprofitable meme stock that was already up over a 100% in the last two days, then well you just got what you deserved. Take profits, kids.	35

Be careful out there boys"	28

3. **The volume is not even 15% of the free float**
4. **Open interest for puts expiring this Friday is 3.7 times larger than calls that means gamma squeeze is not even a remote probability.**

Let me tell you why, because they know you will buy far OTM calls the moment you see a 5-6% spike and then they will slowly bleed the SP in next trading days to kill those calls (and also puts). I said this long ago, this will keep repeating many more times.

gvljr2m	"I've been AFK for a bit from the modchat and discord. They uncovered evidence that they're pretty sure makes MVIS a pump, something about emails being sent around from which DD is being copy+pasted here or something, and brigading. Idk the specifics, I'm out of the loop.

It turns out they were blocking that ticker sporadically yesterday (via automod) while trying to figure out what to do. Personally I think the right move would have been publicly saying something **first** then blocking it **second**, but I wasn't involved in the decision. I had about as much information as any of you had about it up until twenty minutes ago, which is a problem because how were you supposed to know why it was happening if I didn't either?

So no, my bots are not to blame. WSB is not fuk. It is not some nefarious conspiracy. It is not *hedge fund shilling*. The mods are not on the take. They're not pumping MVIS, they're not dumping MVIS. It has no relation to GME. It's just people being shortsighted and trying to do the right thing. Sorry for technically lying to a bunch of people yesterday saying ""omg we don't block MVIS"". **That part bothers me the most.**

I'm not trying to throw anyone under the bus, those dudes are my homies, I'm trying to stop the entire community from getting thrown under the bus by decent decisions made with terrible optics/implementation. We've already got enough conspiracy theory stuff being leveled at us without giving them more ammo by doing the right thing the wrong way. We very rarely block any ticker because.. y'know.. people thought GME was a pump too since people liked it. Just how it is. I can't even think of the last ticker we blocked.

EDIT: To be clear, I have no idea if MVIS will be considered spam or not, but that's what's been going on. And most of these angry replies are from people with a ton of history in the MVIS subreddit, which is kind of a problem in itself that I don't know how to handle.

**EDIT 2:** The issue isn't settled FYI. They're talking about it, I expect you'll either see what they considered when making the call yesterday or have it unblocked. I think if we're gonna do something like this what we have to show for it should withstand public scrutiny. We'll try to do it that way going forward."	188

-It‚Äôs just been proposed, there is no actual legislation currently making its way thru Congress

-If it makes it to the senate, Manchin will almost assuredly block it

-If/when that happens, they‚Äôll revise it to a version that‚Äôs so watered-down it won‚Äôt have any major impact on anyone (certainly not anyone on WSB, anyways)

gvh2qsf	"Taxes have never, ever, ever, EVER been a threat to the stock market.  So stop this noise. The rich will be ok. You can stop crying for them.  They never cry for you. 

The biggest threat to the stock market is INFLATION.  Black and Decker, Whirlpool, Proctor and Gamble, and a litany of other massive, important consumer goods companies have announced across the board price increases in their product lines by the fall, just in time for Christmas.  If middle and lower class people are postponing discretionary purchases, then you can kiss any bulls goodbye.  

That‚Äôs your real threat to the stock market and it‚Äôs building steam.  The government raising revenue to pay for capital investments and projects has NEVER HURT THE MARKET!  Source:  history."	22

It's basically been in a perfect tight bull flag decline/consolidation the past month while equities broke out...

Whichever direction the 10 year breaks will likely result in a huge corresponding move in tech/growth and value stocks just like we saw in Feb-March.

We're likely to see another big rotation wave if the 10 year breaks out and attempts a run at 2+%.

Worth keeping an eye on imo since everything is correlated here.

Market Beta values across assets are the highest they've been since the 90s.  So all these things are going to move in concert..."	50

Some one needs to make a company where they make contracts with all these streaming companies and host their services in one platform, but that wouldnt happen because of greedy fucks	23

gvb749v	"Futures are flat after a second straight day of losses for stock markets. Small caps are showing signs of life, up about 0.5%. That‚Äôs as of 0630. Yesterday the Russell 2000 dropped 2% and the Nasdaq almost 1%.

There was a very clear reversal in the reopening trade, with pandemic-sensitive names like travel companies seeing most of the selling, while stay-at-home stocks like Costco and Clorox benefited. 

One pandemic winner that didn‚Äôt go along for this ride was Netflix, which reported a slowdown in subscriber growth. NFLX is being punished, down to almost $500 per share. We did have earnings beats from Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble, and JNJ. 

PNG and Coke said they were raising prices, which means inflation is a-coming (or is already here). But then the bond market doesn‚Äôt really seem to care. Maybe it‚Äôs already priced in.

Bottom line: The pandemic fears have not been able to generate much staying power since last April. We‚Äôve seen this movie before and it always turns into a buying opportunity. Will this time be different? 

The macro elements that drive economies ‚Äî interest rates, employment, real estate ‚Äî are all pointing in the right direction. The Fed may be forced to act but we aren‚Äôt there yet. Big picture virus trends are pointing the right way too, at least in the U.S. and most developed markets.

Fear sells. Often people buy it. That‚Äôs where there are opportunities."	24

It‚Äôs all about earnings today. This a day after Goldman, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo beat estimates. As I write this, Bank of America, PepsiCo, and UnitedHealth all came in and all beat on EPS and revenues. BlackRock also just reported and was the one outlier, beating on revenues but falling slightly short on EPS.

Still waiting on Charles Schwab, Citigroup, and U.S. Bancorp to round out the banks, but it looks like those ambitious earnings estimates were not misplaced.

Delta Air will report during market hours. That should be interesting where the reopening trend is concerned.

On the data front, we have retail sales and industrial production out this morning. And of course initial jobless claims seeing how it‚Äôs Thursday.

gumfq54	"I'm officially out for 90 days after being really stupid yesterday and taking 30k to 15k by FUD around tesla and constantly paperhanding stuff and switching calls/puts.

I am actually going to a therapist about my trading because it got so bad this last month.  Scheduled for 2 weeks from now.


I was up bigly (over 100k - I managed to be someone who had bought GME below 30).  Made money on PLUG, AAL, CCIV, apha, sndl (all the things.)

Then I bought into some other meme stocks (sndl, zom, ocgn, pltr) and this last month had me feeling like I needed to ""make it back"".

I had originally just made patient plays starting last March and that the reason I was up at all. Got lucky on some stuff but didn't fuck with day trades.

This last month I epically fucked myself feeling like I had to get back what I lost.  It became an addiction.  Constantly on Ameritrade, wsb, reading news around my stocks.  Not working, feeling sick, not eating, not working out, not spending time productive or relaxing at all.

As soon as insaw any red in my portfolio I'd freak out feeling like ""oh no I have to fix that."" Even though there was no emergency.  

The worst part is I effectively had 2 stupid days where if I had done nothing I still would have been green on the week. But between just those two days I day traded myself to 40k losses.  I consistently chose fear and emotion over the plan I had set out and couldn't control myself.

I constantly feel like I have to fix it and the only way to fix it is to trade. 

It was really fucking with all aspects of my life.  I'd be happy some days, and completely void of emotion others.  

Since I began trading I'm now down 10k overall.  

Hopefully I can work through my shit- this has been all I do every day for months now.  Stare at the chart.  Get emotional. Have no desire to do anything else.  Make bad emotional decisions after making good logical ones only to erase all gains made over weeks in a matter of minutes.


I consider myself lucky I didn't use the margin available and really fuck myself.  -10k suck, but I know others are worse off.

Maybe I'll never return to trading but I'll keep lurking and commenting.  I love this community, even the gay bears, for all the simultaneous support and shifting on people like me fir their terrible decisions."	30

gulnb88	"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Things are looking bright and sunny today.

* Companies are smashing earnings expectations across the board
* Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000.
* [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**. 

That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.

*[I try to predict the NASDAQ every day. See past prediction results and visualizations here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/yEPBC)*"	20

Mr Powell: ""We are definitely happy with the results so far but we are still a long way to go from where we want to be before we can consider ending QE or raising rates. The reality is, unemployment is still above 0%, cancer is still around, and the sky is still blue. What we are looking for is negative unemployment, and what we mean by this is we want people to hold multiple jobs. We want cancer to be eliminated. And finally, we want the sky to become green.

He said he'd get 500. In my head, I thought he got $500 worth. I completely forgot about it for about the last 15 or so years. Yesterday I called him and asked ""Hey remember when you bought $500 worth of Nvidia stock? It's probably worth like 40 grand now if you're still holding it!"" 

He said he was still holding, but made one correction. He didn't buy $500 worth, he bought 500 shares, and it's now worth over $300k.
