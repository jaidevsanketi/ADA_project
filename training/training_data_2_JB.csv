gu91wjg	Weed gang is going to be in shambles after they wake up this afternoon.	142	
gu8pory	"Futures are a bit lower this morning, with major indices in the U.S. all down about 0.2% to 0.3% as of 0645. Not much action in the bond market — 10-year yields holding steady around 1.657%. Asia is seeing a bit of selling, with stock markets in China and Hong Kong down about 1%. The Nikkei in Japan is down about 0.8%. This all follows another record close for stocks on Friday. 

This week stands to be the busiest in some time with first quarter earnings season kicking off. That isn’t until Wednesday though, when the banks report. Before that we have CPIs on Tuesday. A bunch of Fed honchos are speaking this week, perhaps as a result of the inflation report.

We already had Powell last night on 60 minutes. It does look a bit like the Fed may be preparing for a spike in inflation with Powell saying “we're at a place where the economy is about to start growing much more quickly and job creation coming in much more quickly,"" due to vaccines and fiscal support.

Not sure that will matter if tomorrow’s CPI numbers exceeds expectations. But we’ll deal with that tomorrow. Speaking of expectations, the forecast for earnings is quite positive indeed — maybe too positive. But we’ll deal with that on Wednesday and later in the week.

So for now it’s another day of wait-and-see, and of course pontificate. No shortage of that. Big picture it still doesn’t seem to make all that much sense to bet against the market."	94

 We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. **Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled**.

Entire thing is incoherent word salad and the ""facts"" it links to is shit like ""Melvin is still holding 6 million puts in February after the hearing!""  But get this, THEIR supplied link to the 13f shows that it was reported in February but like every fucking 13f out there it's based on calendar quarter data.  So they're saying Melvin lied about being short in February because they still had 6 million puts in *December*.  And no one there even realizes or understands this.

Weirdly, bonds are being bid up a bit as well. Ten-year Treasuries now yielding 1.65% and the 2-year is at 0.15%. That’s as of 0640.

This follows a pretty boring day where very little happened but the S&P still closed at another record high. Fed minutes showed no major debate on much of anything, with officials showing a unified stance on their ultra-loose policy.

Fed chair Powell is due to speak today at noon EDT. This is apparently part of a panel discussion at the IMF spring meetings, so it’s not like he will be taking questions. Wouldn’t expect much to come of that. Powell can stick to his stump speech on economic recovery and inflation and unemployment and be done with it. 

We also have initial jobless claims out at 0830 as we do every Thursday. 680k new claims are expected, which would be about 5% less than last week’s 720k number. If the number is too good then it will cue the inevitable talk about inflation and concerns about Fed tightening.

Saw one person sold his GF's engagement ring and if GME ""dosen't work out she'll have to wait another year or so"" (hopefully that was a troll). There are smart people that that got in and out at the right time, and even now people with low average cost per share are in a decent position, but the constant desperation to get people to buy into GME has really grown out of control. If GME dosn't go up (personally I think it may a bit but I think the squeeze already happened) it's gonna leave so many young people in a bad position."	21

3. Only play weeklies and 0dte if you know what's up. Otherwise stick to AT LEAST 1 month out expiry, or 2 month - for added safety (though reduced leverage, thus reduced potential gain and loss).
4. Buy ITM or ATM only. OTM options is why you always lose, even if you picked the direction right.
5. This is all just a game. If you're here to solve your financial problems - stop and talk to a professional financial advisor. This is 100% gambling.

It’s been real but I officially retire from the stock market. Was up in the air about it but after today this is it. I am down $117K since 2/16. 

It is statistically near impossible to do the opposite of the right thing several hundred times for months. Maybe it was meant to be. 

$20K left to my name. Waiting for Bali to reopen and disappearing into the jungle forever.

If you actually read and believe the DD about the new vision of the company and eccomerce and gaming then revenue up is good news and share offering is good news.

If you just believe in the squeeze then this has to go through the SEC first. The government. Slow as hell. Meanwhile DFV will presumably exercise his contracts by 4/16 and the blackout period ends around the same time.

There just isn’t all that much to move the market. (By the way, notice how quickly we’ve already moved on from Archegos?) Earnings season doesn’t kick off for another couple of weeks and there just don’t seem to be any catalysts until then.

We do have the ADP jobs numbers for March, scheduled for release before the open. 550,000 new jobs are expected. This usually doesn’t move things very much unless there’s major deviation from what’s anticipated.

That leaves us with today’s infrastructure announcement by the Biden administration. Lots of drama around this already, as can be expected from an incoming administration’s first major piece of legislation (not to mentioned the poisoned political climate we find ourselves in).

But details of these plans have (been) leaked out already and frankly they don’t look particularly draconian where tax policy is concerned: Corporate taxes will be raised from 21% to 28%. That’s still well below the 35% level that existed prior to Trump’s tax cuts.

That’s it. Nothing about income taxes on individuals, wealthy or otherwise. Some talk about discouraging tax havens for corporations that I’m sure will be well heeded but ultimately go nowhere.

So unless the Biden administration is hiding its true intentions with this infrastructure bill, there doesn’t seem to be any reason for concern. There could of course be further policy announcements forthcoming. Maybe that’s what the market is worried about. But even then, the Democrats’ majority in the Senate is razor thin.

In the end this whole infrastructure bill may just end up being more PR than anything else. Certainly wouldn’t be the first time."	24
