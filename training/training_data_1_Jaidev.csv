gw1fqn7	"I check facebook like once a month.

Every time I do, I unfollow everyone who posts shit that irritates me. 

I just went to facebook this month, and it's literally just a wall of ads. Not a single person, just ads. Over time, I legit unfollowed every single person I've ever known because they annoy me.

Anyway SPY 420c"	112

gvljr2m	"I've been AFK for a bit from the modchat and discord. They uncovered evidence that they're pretty sure makes MVIS a pump, something about emails being sent around from which DD is being copy+pasted here or something, and brigading. Idk the specifics, I'm out of the loop.

It turns out they were blocking that ticker sporadically yesterday (via automod) while trying to figure out what to do. Personally I think the right move would have been publicly saying something **first** then blocking it **second**, but I wasn't involved in the decision. I had about as much information as any of you had about it up until twenty minutes ago, which is a problem because how were you supposed to know why it was happening if I didn't either?

So no, my bots are not to blame. WSB is not fuk. It is not some nefarious conspiracy. It is not *hedge fund shilling*. The mods are not on the take. They're not pumping MVIS, they're not dumping MVIS. It has no relation to GME. It's just people being shortsighted and trying to do the right thing. Sorry for technically lying to a bunch of people yesterday saying ""omg we don't block MVIS"". **That part bothers me the most.**

I'm not trying to throw anyone under the bus, those dudes are my homies, I'm trying to stop the entire community from getting thrown under the bus by decent decisions made with terrible optics/implementation. We've already got enough conspiracy theory stuff being leveled at us without giving them more ammo by doing the right thing the wrong way. We very rarely block any ticker because.. y'know.. people thought GME was a pump too since people liked it. Just how it is. I can't even think of the last ticker we blocked.

EDIT: To be clear, I have no idea if MVIS will be considered spam or not, but that's what's been going on. And most of these angry replies are from people with a ton of history in the MVIS subreddit, which is kind of a problem in itself that I don't know how to handle.

**EDIT 2:** The issue isn't settled FYI. They're talking about it, I expect you'll either see what they considered when making the call yesterday or have it unblocked. I think if we're gonna do something like this what we have to show for it should withstand public scrutiny. We'll try to do it that way going forward."	187

It's basically been in a perfect tight bull flag decline/consolidation the past month while equities broke out...

Whichever direction the 10 year breaks will likely result in a huge corresponding move in tech/growth and value stocks just like we saw in Feb-March.

We're likely to see another big rotation wave if the 10 year breaks out and attempts a run at 2+%.

Worth keeping an eye on imo since everything is correlated here.

Market Beta values across assets are the highest they've been since the 90s.  So all these things are going to move in concert..."	48

Great for high intensity sprints, but this leads to small kids, animals, and toys getting sucked underneath the treadmill.

It‚Äôs all about earnings today. This a day after Goldman, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo beat estimates. As I write this, Bank of America, PepsiCo, and UnitedHealth all came in and all beat on EPS and revenues. BlackRock also just reported and was the one outlier, beating on revenues but falling slightly short on EPS.

Still waiting on Charles Schwab, Citigroup, and U.S. Bancorp to round out the banks, but it looks like those ambitious earnings estimates were not misplaced.

Delta Air will report during market hours. That should be interesting where the reopening trend is concerned.

On the data front, we have retail sales and industrial production out this morning. And of course initial jobless claims seeing how it‚Äôs Thursday.

Bottom line: Things are looking pretty good for risk assets. Concerns about JNJ‚Äôs vaccine have faded. The reopening trend remains in force, at least in the U.S."	28

gumfq54	"I'm officially out for 90 days after being really stupid yesterday and taking 30k to 15k by FUD around tesla and constantly paperhanding stuff and switching calls/puts.

I am actually going to a therapist about my trading because it got so bad this last month.  Scheduled for 2 weeks from now.


I was up bigly (over 100k - I managed to be someone who had bought GME below 30).  Made money on PLUG, AAL, CCIV, apha, sndl (all the things.)

Then I bought into some other meme stocks (sndl, zom, ocgn, pltr) and this last month had me feeling like I needed to ""make it back"".

I had originally just made patient plays starting last March and that the reason I was up at all. Got lucky on some stuff but didn't fuck with day trades.

This last month I epically fucked myself feeling like I had to get back what I lost.  It became an addiction.  Constantly on Ameritrade, wsb, reading news around my stocks.  Not working, feeling sick, not eating, not working out, not spending time productive or relaxing at all.

As soon as insaw any red in my portfolio I'd freak out feeling like ""oh no I have to fix that."" Even though there was no emergency.  

The worst part is I effectively had 2 stupid days where if I had done nothing I still would have been green on the week. But between just those two days I day traded myself to 40k losses.  I consistently chose fear and emotion over the plan I had set out and couldn't control myself.

I constantly feel like I have to fix it and the only way to fix it is to trade. 

It was really fucking with all aspects of my life.  I'd be happy some days, and completely void of emotion others.  

Since I began trading I'm now down 10k overall.  

Hopefully I can work through my shit- this has been all I do every day for months now.  Stare at the chart.  Get emotional. Have no desire to do anything else.  Make bad emotional decisions after making good logical ones only to erase all gains made over weeks in a matter of minutes.


I consider myself lucky I didn't use the margin available and really fuck myself.  -10k suck, but I know others are worse off.

Maybe I'll never return to trading but I'll keep lurking and commenting.  I love this community, even the gay bears, for all the simultaneous support and shifting on people like me fir their terrible decisions."	27

gulnb88	"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Things are looking bright and sunny today.

* Companies are smashing earnings expectations across the board
* Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000.
* [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**. 

That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.

*[I try to predict the NASDAQ every day. See past prediction results and visualizations here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/yEPBC)*"	19
