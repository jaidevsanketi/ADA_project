gw1x11g	FOMOing into MVIS after it’s gone up 150% in a week is exactly what wsb is all about.		107
gw1k5i0	MVIS down by $0.66 and the bears all come out like I TOLD YOU SO lmaooo		90

gw1e1s5	"If MindMed hits 10$ tomorrow I will go and trip on 5g of mushrooms.

Only done 3g before and it would be great DD too!"		80
gw25yqg	"I’ve been on here for several years now and it’s incredible how predictable the patterns become. If you didn’t think MVIS was going to tank by 20% today, then you should look at the charts for any other WSB pick.

One week out: Multiple DD posts start hitting front page

Three days out: Ticker starts dominating the daily thread

One day out: Nothing but newb comments. “Do you think X will keep going up??!”

Crash"		82

gw1n6j5	"Yes, there are lots of shiny, new,  moonly stocks out there. And ya'll are out chasing them around and dancing and having a great,  silly time. But that's not for me.  No, sir. I live a stable,  predictable life.

I am in bed at 9:30 pm every night. I drink my coffee at 6:05 every morning. And I watch my PLTR investment slowly decline every morning at 6:30."		55

gw2ldtj	People bitching about MVIS... if you didn't make money off it being up over 100% that's your fucken problem.		35
gw1ajlc	Can't make my mind up if I wanna yolo into MNMD or MVIS		34
gw1bwwo	Sorry guys I'll be buying calls on MVIS today so the rally is doomed		35
gw1ibco	MVIS dipped, I bought a little more. I feel like we've played this game before		32
gw1neow	I have no idea what MVIS will do, but these idiots who didn't make any money and don't have puts just want it to tank so they feel better about being a pussy. Everybody wins and losses you cucks. Your rooting for a loss because your Vagina hurts. Probably all bagholding SNDL.		33
gw2dyze	MVIS 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. Let’s see some loss porn from those who fell for the trap. When will you learn this place loves loss porn?? If you got in early and sold congrats.		34
gw1d1w4	GME $200 at open		31

gw1awgg	"MVIS 2500 WSB mentions.
Volume 214,000,000 

Media: WSB chose to make MVIS the new meme stock causing prices to soar.

Thanks ,Ace.  Top notch reporting.  

Let's keep pretending the redditors in here with their 2 17c are causing shot like this and ignore the power of the big firms fucking with eachother."		30
gw1ejcd	I see MNMD but my brain just thinks NNDM. Apparently I need some of that magical brain medicine.		28
gw1eyqv	Only MVIS and GME make sense today		26
gw1iint	“MVIS iS SoOO rEd” it’s literally at yesterday’s close you paperhanded fucks		28
gw1kd4r	MNMD for the new tripping balls sector. MVIS calls for tendies. Then calls in SDS, SQQQ, and SDOW to short the market if it corrects soon. UVXY for volatility. Hold GME as usual like a good ape		27
gw1psxi	"What do we want? SHROOMS.

When do we want them? NOW!"		27
gw1q780	NNDM (nano dimensions) is up in premarket because you retards don’t know the godamn ticker for MindMed is MNMD		28
gw1rbfu	MVIS come on boys KEEP GOING! 🚀🚀🚀		26
gw1s3xd	Still holding GME since Jan 25 checking in 🙏		27
gw1v29k	Wow.  MVIS & MNMD  just Thanos fucked half this sub out of existence.		29
gw1y4aw	MVIS, OCGN, MNMD.  Multiple bag holding opportunities!  WSB is back!		29
gw1yd7e	Doubled my money on MVIS, and then lost those gains on MNMD. This is the WallStreetBets way.		29
gw1z1jl	GME to the moon 🚀		30
gw2e8sp	Imagine buying MVIS at $28 lol		32
gw2fpds	Lmao people that bought MVIS yesterday 🤡💼		27
gw2py83	OMG... I can't believe MVIS is down to levels not seen since... *Checks charts* since yesterday's open?!		30
gw2teml	I hate all of you who weren't here before $GME.		26
gw197vx	So is MVIS the distraction from GME or is GME the distraction from MVIS? Or are they both distractions from AMC? Or are they all distractions, or possibly none of them distractions? Maybe, just maybe they are all just stocks. Or conspiracies. Or both. So many questions.		29
gw1wnpr	#show me that MVIS loss porn		28
gw1ip9c	buy the MVIS dip fellow apes!		26
gw1jkwy	MVIS will be green by open and +10% by 10AM. It’s so obvious and sad people will miss this		24
gw1jw81	MVIS up over 160% in less than five days. “Guys I don’t understand why it’s down 3% premarket right now”		25
gw1pjck	"I've decided I will only use products of stocks I own. So today I am eating every meal at McDonald's, heading to GME for some games, doing some shrooms from MNMD while watching an AMC movie. Then I will drive home in my TSLA, if I crash, I got stock in GEICO.

100% profits."		27
gw1v182	"I feel bad for anybody that saw all the MVIS comments these past few days and decided to hop in after it already rocketed. A LOT of those bullish MVIS comments were made by bots or purchased accounts. Found a few yesterday myself. 

One account had 15+ bullish MVIS comments just yesterday and yet prior to yesterday the account hadn’t commented for over a year, and the only comments the account had from a year ago were military related and there were only like 7 comments. 

Be careful out there boys"		29
gw1vxp1	PSA: Anyone telling you to hold or buy more just wants you to drive the price back up so they can sell for a better price. They don't give a fuck about your account.		28
gw1y5aq	I’m investing long term on MVIS 🤡		28
gw28vim	Y’all so quick to shit on MVIS when it’s still up over 100% since last week and is holding around $22. I definitely don’t know what’s gonna happen with this stock, but the reaction seems disproportionate to the price movement thus far.		26
gw2bogc	"I felt like MVIS was such a huge win being up 5k yesterday 

Than I hit that 3 month chart.. 

[GUH](https://i.imgur.com/eDFt7RN.jpg)"		28
gw30wfa	okay MVIS bagholders stand up so we can all mock you		27
gw1arvs	GME is blasting through 200 today and then it will be absolutely unstoppable		24
gw1h5gy	GME is up 11% in pre market... RSI is steady, MACD healthy, EMA crossed MA on 20, 50 and 200 day. Melvin Capital website is down. Paper shredder vans seen outside shitadel. BULLISH AF		28
gw1jh5l	Cmon boys. MVIS isn’t done yet. Buy the fucking dip and send her over 30!!!		25
gw1jzru	That’s the lowest MVIS will go. All up from here🚀🚀🚀		24
gw1kb1f	I cleaned my whole house yesterday, floors and all.  If I'm gonna do dumb shit like sell all my MVIS shares last Friday for $18 I deserve to clean floors the rest of my life!  😁👍		28
gw1o3aj	Holy fuck ive been spending hours on DD when all I have to do is look at oreo stuffing! This is groundbreaking		27
gw1opyr	It’s MNMD not NNDM		27
gw24p65	"Where is MVIS gang 🤡

How tf do you think its okay to buy calls after a  100%+ rise.... the IV alone would kill you"		27
gw2kg2i	BB rising from the ashes		28
gw1l5wq	I am not in MVIS but all the bearish sentiment seems to be coming from new accounts		23
gw1lrq8	Imagine paperhanded MVIS during that dip to 25. Watch this goes to 35 this week. Remember GME dipped hard and shot to 300.		22
gw1noxp	"Those who said, MVIS is dead, going downtrend pre-market, and laughing at us retards.
In your fucking faces, we going MOONSKI, bytches!"		24

*I'm watching 3 screens:*

*On one screen, I'm watching this thread with people gushing about MVIS.*

*On  the other screen, I'm watching the dark pool action on buying up shares  of MVIS, and I'm remembering where I've seen this movie before (the  movie theater, Nokia, BB, the weed stocks, Express, etc.)*

*Then there's the screen in my brain, which is showing how epic this rug pull is going to be later this week.*

Oh, the hate, the HATE I got for that.  The fuck off, you don't know what you're talking abouts, the ""you can't possibly know what those orders are because they're blocks"", etc.

Market makers gonna fight the shorts.

gw1xyfa	RIP MVIS final wave FOMO buyers at $25.		16
gw1yla9	"I bought into most of my MVIS around 18$. This was one of the first investments I ever made. I also bought into Tilray, Webilt, and Clov for the long term. 

I rode MVIS up to 29$ and was planning to hold thru today. But it appears the party is over and I'd rather not be caught with my pants around my ankles. I only had a few hundred dollars invested as this was purely for practice investing. I just wanted to invest a little, learn about stocks, research, and try to make a Lil profit. 

I sold off my MVIS at around 25$ for a tidy profit of 60$ or so. Very happy as a total noob. If it pops off again later in the week I'll be bummed out but as of right now I'm just happy for playing things safer and smarter and leaving with more than I put in. I'll continue to invest as my confidence grows. 

Remember, there will always be another MVIS. Don't get attached to stocks. They're not pets or loved ones. Let them go when it's their time"		17

After becoming a darling of the MVIS crowd, Cramer is now a villain for calling the stock overpriced. His comments have caused a dump, further entrenching the hate for him on Wall Street Bets.

Meanwhile, Meme Money was seen moving into MNMD. It is no surprise the WSB gang are attracted to substances that allow them to escape their lives. Expect a moon mission of epic proportions."		14

MVIS - seems like a p&d to me, and we appear to be at the ‘d’ part. Imo the fundamentals just don’t support it going any higher than it currently is. I’ve been wrong before, tho.

MNMD - this is a good long-term hold (I’m talking years down the line), but trying to make money off it today (or anytime soon) is probly gonna be pretty hard.

GME - honestly I don’t even fucking know at this point. Anyone know if there’s any specific catalysts causing the surge, or is it just pure retard strength?"		16

gw1jf15	"More than that... this is a calculated walk down that can only happen this efficiently with fewer shares in PM/AH... they know they'll get flooded with volume at the open. Their goal is to influence sentiment as much as possible while covering as much of their short positions as possible to free up the borrowed shares so that they can either a) short the shit out of it at the open if they influenced sentiment enough to force a dip or b) have those shares available to short the shit out of us at the top when the momentum dies down

Mvis🚀🚀"		14

gw1ts66	The fucks hyping MVIS yesterday, and today themselves selling, pretending to “celebrate” this “buying opportunity” are exactly what’s wrong with this community.

Furthermore people believe that LIDAR companies like LAZR, VLDR and MVIS are several billion dollar acquisitions in the waiting.

gw1bb3a	"Stock futures are flat this morning. Nothing doing at all really. Yesterday all but the Dow Industrials were positive and the S&P and Nasdaq closed at new record highs..

It should be a busy day with plenty of earnings to move things along. As I write this, UPS just came in with a beat on earnings and revenues. That’s another good sign for the economy. During market hours we’ll hear from 3M, Hasbro, JetBlue, Starbucks, Wynn Resorts, and others. After the close it will be Google/Alphabet, AMD, Microsoft, Texas Instruments, and Visa. Many others as well but those are the ones that have my attention.

We also have the start of the Fed meetings today, but shouldn’t be hearing very much from that until tomorrow.

Stocks have been quietly ‘melting up’ for awhile. That may accelerate. Commodities are cranking along, with copper, wheat, corn, soybeans, and coffee at or near multi-year highs. The ‘soft commodities’ (wheat, corn, soybeans) are particularly frothy. Check out the charts if you have a chance.

Until the inflation narrative takes hold and forces the Fed to start tapering it should still be all systems go for risk assets. Some earnings disappointments notwithstanding of course."		10

gw1ku0s	PLTR really gonna say fuck it and go for another green day?		11
gw1lfir	OCGN is not as exciting as MVIS :(		11
gw1lilh	I could write the most amazing DD on MNMD like their recent partnership & starting a school at the prestigious NYU that coincides with their research but I feel like the collective consciousness is already at work 🛐		12
gw1llf0	Since -.11% was the rug being pulled from MVIS according to bears, I guess we can say MVIS is mooning now.		11
gw1lyn5	Still bagholding BB, NOK, UWMC. No way I’m going to sell for loss, but my kids might after I pass the bags		12
gw1maep	Y’all shut the fuck up real quick with the MVIS bagholder comments huh? Salty ass bitches who missed the tendie train.		12

gw1sj6n	Remember those like 2 days where everyone wouldn't shut the fuck up about CLOV and now you hear nothing? Thats gonna be MVIS by the end of the week		12
gw1slca	Fellow apes - welcome to MindMed. I have been in this since 0.50. You see these fluctuations regularly, but the trend is up. We set ATH on massive volume, stay calm, rejoice and be strong apes. For we will come out stronger, together.		12

gw1uusi	Congrats to those who were brave enough to buy MVIS puts. I wasn’t.		11
gw1vcqo	The reactions in this group are so short sighted. MVIS is a good company. Yes after a stock rises $10 in one day it's due for a market sell off.  Can't handle panicked teenie boppers anymore.		11

Hearing them speak in person really helped highlight how massively retarded many people are and how easy they are to exploit. Fuckers have ZERO idea how anything works other than “haha stonk is up massively I’m gonna buy it!!!!”

gvxo2p8	People saying to sell MVIS are spreading FUD because they missed the boat lol		32
gvygp8c	"Why is this sudden spike of GME?

1. **There is no news**
2. **There are over 600K shares available to borrow, in Fidelity alone, with only 0.75% interest rate**
3. **The volume is not even 15% of the free float**
4. **Open interest for puts expiring this Friday is 3.7 times larger than calls that means gamma squeeze is not even a remote probability.**

Let me tell you why, because they know you will buy far OTM calls the moment you see a 5-6% spike and then they will slowly bleed the SP in next trading days to kill those calls (and also puts). I said this long ago, this will keep repeating many more times.

Go ahead and start downvoting!"		33

gvy6e8n	MVIS and GME are similar in a way that they are kind of small cap and don't have a lot of shares outstanding, which means it's easier to push up the price if we keep buying than it would be with a larger cap company with a billion shares outstanding. All in on MVIS.		22
gvy6v26	Thank you MVIS. Literally bought at the top a few weeks ago. Held on to being down 70%. Closed today up 100%. Good enough for me. It's been ripping for almost a week. I feel it's got to pull back at some point.		20

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** strike leap calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **97.00** which gives us a total value of:

#$970,000

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

I had some shares when it was around 10/11 just over a week ago. I noticed the quite high short interest and commented something about it saying it could squeeze soon or we could see a bunch of people hop on. However, it got downvotes a bunch, and after reading some bearish cases I sold 🤷‍♂️ I thought they’re probably worth $5 unless a buyout. 

Anyway, here I am. An idiot

Edit: call me a fucking tart, I am one"		14

On the other screen, I'm watching the dark pool action on buying up shares of MVIS, and I'm remembering where I've seen this movie before (the movie theater, Nokia, BB, the weed stocks, Express, etc.)

* MVIS puts
* the apes think it's going to $100
* it clearly can't break the previous 'hype' high of $24.18 (hint: it wont)
* MVIS will be back down to $16 right after earnings
* MVIS will be back down to $10 by 5/21
* may the odds be ever in your favor!

gvljr2m	"I've been AFK for a bit from the modchat and discord. They uncovered evidence that they're pretty sure makes MVIS a pump, something about emails being sent around from which DD is being copy+pasted here or something, and brigading. Idk the specifics, I'm out of the loop.

It turns out they were blocking that ticker sporadically yesterday (via automod) while trying to figure out what to do. Personally I think the right move would have been publicly saying something **first** then blocking it **second**, but I wasn't involved in the decision. I had about as much information as any of you had about it up until twenty minutes ago, which is a problem because how were you supposed to know why it was happening if I didn't either?

So no, my bots are not to blame. WSB is not fuk. It is not some nefarious conspiracy. It is not *hedge fund shilling*. The mods are not on the take. They're not pumping MVIS, they're not dumping MVIS. It has no relation to GME. It's just people being shortsighted and trying to do the right thing. Sorry for technically lying to a bunch of people yesterday saying ""omg we don't block MVIS"". **That part bothers me the most.**

I'm not trying to throw anyone under the bus, those dudes are my homies, I'm trying to stop the entire community from getting thrown under the bus by decent decisions made with terrible optics/implementation. We've already got enough conspiracy theory stuff being leveled at us without giving them more ammo by doing the right thing the wrong way. We very rarely block any ticker because.. y'know.. people thought GME was a pump too since people liked it. Just how it is. I can't even think of the last ticker we blocked.

EDIT: To be clear, I have no idea if MVIS will be considered spam or not, but that's what's been going on. And most of these angry replies are from people with a ton of history in the MVIS subreddit, which is kind of a problem in itself that I don't know how to handle.

**EDIT 2:** The issue isn't settled FYI. They're talking about it, I expect you'll either see what they considered when making the call yesterday or have it unblocked. I think if we're gonna do something like this what we have to show for it should withstand public scrutiny. We'll try to do it that way going forward."		186

gvl6jzs	"Why it's time to take your profit on OCGN:

I have been following OCGN for months when they initially partnered with Bharat Bioscience and was initially extremely bullish and rode OCGN from $6 to 16 the first time. After doing more DD, there are too many risks for OCGN to be valued at 2B.  


* OCGN only makes money on Covaxin vaccinations in the US
* The 70% efficacy is significantly below both Pfizer and Moderna, which we already mass producing enough of to cover the entire population forever
* They still need EUA approval, which will take several weeks if not months, as there would still need to be an independent trial conducted in the US
* By the time their vaccine is maybe approved, 80%+ of people in the US would already be vaccinated
* Covaxin takes a long time to manufacture and OCGN still needs to develop the manufacturing facilities in the US to even start manufacturing
* The price of vaccine is low, like $10-20 total, the small margins then are split among OCGN and Bharat Bioscience(the company who developed the vaccine)
* They only make 45% of profit per vaccination in the US, only place where they can sell it, which is about\~$5 They would need 25 Million vaccinations a year just to make 125M, not happening
* They had adverse reaction issues they swept under the rug in India in order to fast track this to market

TLDR Even if OCGN gets EUA, it will take too long for them to get the vaccine to market in the US, the margins will be low, the market will be saturated, and their efficacy is lower than American competitors. 

Positions: small short position of 300 shares, will add on as hype dies"		19

$COIN represents under 1.5% of ARKF. While that is bigger than my .28% in my own portfolio, that is a rounding error!

Look at the 1 year and 5 year charts? All you geniuses beating those returns? Look at the scores of companies she has been in early. Think she freaks out about 2-3 week short term shit while she is building out a position?

I would garner to say that the same folks shitting on Cathie also shat on $TSLA winners, $GME winners, and many winners that they always 💩 and miss out on. 

I am currently long 10 shares $COIN and will buy LEAPS today in ARKF. 

Just watched another interview w her and Cathie bae is sexy af. Fucking stonk scientist 👩‍🔬

Hold it for 2 hours while it moons then dump and buy puts so you don't bag hold. Everyone thought clov was a sure thing so I said fuck that. Oh ppl on the sub keep complaining about AMD touching 80 and going down? bought the dip after it comes back from 80... everyone in sub saying bulls are fucked for SPY? Got some calls just before close. Everyone hyped on PLTR but gets mad that it can't break 24. Buy puts whenever it gets close to 24. I love you guysemote:free\_emotes\_pack:heart\_eyes\_rainbow		19

gvlq3wc	VIAC is making its way. I bought some more calls today. Can't wait for next week!		8
gvlrkvc	Acting like I'm tough and bullish because I'm holding my SPY 4/26 $418C over the weekend when in reality it's because I'm on PDT restrictions 🙂		7
gvlrmnv	"I saw a askreddit yesterday on ""what feels like a cult"" or something and the third or forth answer in top was PTON. Apparently people still can't stop telling their friends about it."		7

gvkdpfb	"**How much $25k invested in SPY in March 2020 is worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** strike leap calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **93.70** which gives us a total value of:

#$937,000

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

gvkgse8	All you need to know about GME is the TA that shows the wedge ending next week (or today) and the 21 day cycle of the spikes in price. If nothing happens on the 26th I’m moving on to greener pastures. Everything else being said is an absolute load of Qanon bullshit.		5

If middle and lower class people are postponing discretionary purchases, then you can kiss any bulls goodbye.

gvfh22n	AT&T just beat earnings.. $0.86 per share vs expected $0.78.		9
gvfh8cc	"Stock futures are down a bit as of 0630. The Russell 2000 is off about 0.3%, Nasdaq and Dow by about 0.1%. S&P 500 roughly flat. This follows a day of major gains across risk assets. Russell 2000 added 2.3% yesterday, with the Nasdaq clocking gains of 1.2%.

If only somebody had told you yesterday might be a buying opportunity? Oh wait, somebody did and that somebody was me.

In fairness it isn’t hard to predict these things when you just have the same patterns repeating themselves. When stocks sell off due to anything related to COVID, it’s been a safe bet that the situation will reverse itself after a couple of days. 

Not ready to make any major predictions about today though. It’s another busy day of earnings: AT&T and Biogen among those reporting before the bell. Dow Inc. just came in ahead of estimates. Later we have reopening stocks American Airlines and Southwest Airlines. Airlines have been one of the few disappointments during earnings season so far.

We also have initial jobless claims at 0830 and existing home sales at 1000.

Stocks are still about 1% off of the record highs they set last week so who knows there probably is more upside in the medium term."		12

gvfn1nq	"AT&T When the ultimate boomer is about to break out. (Cheap CALLS & Low IV) 

T has been trading sideways for over 2 years however they just might be about to break out from $30 all the way to $34- $35. That’s hardly a breakout but for T that’s a big deal and for it’s CALL OPTIONS even more.  They are cheap & have a very low IV (the dream). 

They report today and their cell phone, internet, direct tv businesses really don’t matter at all.  It’s ALL ABOUT HBO-MAX.  If their new subscription #’s are above estimate T will most likely will earn a multiple expansion just like DISC & VIAC did.  

So far this year it’s nudged above $31 only to retract back to $29-$30.   Premarket it’s up almost 4% and trading at $31.25 (you never see this type of action from T)

IF IT CLEARS $31.50 the fucker is going to $33-$35.  If you’re looking for a solid idea this is one of them."		11

No billboards, no sticky threads, no fucking animal adoptions in VIAC's name, no YOLO posts, no charity, don't even check the price. Fucking leave it alone god dammit, lemme at least break even.

The market has somehow anchored off the post-Archegos liquidation price and it never really corrected."		8

gvb749v	"Futures are flat after a second straight day of losses for stock markets. Small caps are showing signs of life, up about 0.5%. That’s as of 0630. Yesterday the Russell 2000 dropped 2% and the Nasdaq almost 1%.

There was a very clear reversal in the reopening trade, with pandemic-sensitive names like travel companies seeing most of the selling, while stay-at-home stocks like Costco and Clorox benefited. 

One pandemic winner that didn’t go along for this ride was Netflix, which reported a slowdown in subscriber growth. NFLX is being punished, down to almost $500 per share. We did have earnings beats from Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble, and JNJ. 

PNG and Coke said they were raising prices, which means inflation is a-coming (or is already here). But then the bond market doesn’t really seem to care. Maybe it’s already priced in.

Bottom line: The pandemic fears have not been able to generate much staying power since last April. We’ve seen this movie before and it always turns into a buying opportunity. Will this time be different? 

The macro elements that drive economies — interest rates, employment, real estate — are all pointing in the right direction. The Fed may be forced to act but we aren’t there yet. Big picture virus trends are pointing the right way too, at least in the U.S. and most developed markets.

Fear sells. Often people buy it. That’s where there are opportunities."		22

gvbzdkn	"AAPL, you useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you’re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as a moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not you were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldritch abomination, but here you are. It’s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel someday will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind’s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowball's chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who’s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not possess a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in. But then again, you are so incredibly abominable that you would probably be able to surpass the worst conceivable failure a living being could possibly make. You are so incredibly pathetic that you are honestly not worthy of any more of my words nor my time. Just know that I will forever detest you for your failure and everything you stand for, and that no matter what happens, I will never ever forgive you.

gvcn88w	"if u read the UVXY prospectus you’ll find that Proshares literally doesn’t even quite understand how their own product works, and they tell you that. “It’s a derivative of a derivative, it’s insanely complex, and literally designed not to be held for over a day.” I’m paraphrasing. 

And if you type “VIX manipulation” into google you’ll find that CBOE was sued for manipulation on their index. 

What did the judge rule? 

Well, they ruled that CBOE wasn’t purposefully manipulating anything. So they got off the hook. The judge didn’t say that the manipulation wasn’t happening, just that it wasn’t Cboe’s fault.

So, the Vix index, which inverses the entire market based on SPX options, can be easily manipulated. In other words, if you have enough money and time, you can manipulate the entire S and P.

I will keep doing research, but the more I learn about the volatility trade, the more shady it gets."		4

The child is fine, just terrified. Most treadmills have a ""pressure"" sensor that will stop turning when it feels too much resistance. With the PTON tread sitting a few inches higher and what looks like no ""pressure"" sensor, the treadmill will just pull harder and increase torque when it feels resistance. Great for high intensity sprints, but this leads to small kids, animals, and toys getting sucked underneath the treadmill.

gv77gt7	"$MVIS

One argument I keep seeing against this stock is that it already ran 3000% or whatever over a year. This company was struggling during Covid with product partners pulling out of deals. They have been spending money developing their best-in-class lidar over several years. The company was and still is being shorted into the ground for not having much revenue.

The same shit was being pulled with GME, except because MVIS is a smaller company, shorts could really go to town and drag the share price into the dirt. The share price last year was NOT indicative whatsoever of the value of this company.

Their lidar technology is ahead of any other lidar manufacturer (and yet MVIS has the lowest market cap), their technology is in Hololens2 (~$22billion army deal) and they have a fuck ton of patents (AR/VR & AV). Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, they all need their tech and MVIS is up for sale.

The real value of MVIS is signifcantly higher than the current share price indicates and MVIS is ready this year to show what they got. Shorts better get out or they will get burnt hard.

TLDR: Fuck shorts man."		13

gv8gytw	"**Personal thoughts on AAPL event:**

**Air Tags:** at $30 these are going to sell like hotcakes and will ultimately be a part of most iPhone user's lives... think of how many that is...

**Podcast subscriptions:** Brand new revenue stream for AAPL. Uncertain how this will work out for them, and I am unconvinced as yet... still it adds to their bottom line however.

**Expanded Apple Card Eligibility:** Great move by AAPL. This can only increase profits.

**New iMac:** The M1 chip is a monster and they can squeeze extra performance out of it by applying more power in a desktop configuration. Colours? I don't give a shit... but there are a lot of people that do. MANY people have been waiting for an Apple Silicon iMac since Apple Silicon was announced last year... floodgates are going to open on orders.

**Apple TV 4K:** Decent performance and functionality update, but the real star of the show is the new Siri Remote. I think folks underestimate how much the previous version was despised by the Apple community. These are going to fly off the shelves.

**iPad Pro XDR:** This is an amazing update, but I think it is limited to more of a niche market. Will be substantially eclipsed in sales by the smaller version, which will do very well at that price point. M1 chip inclusion COULD have enabled them to run macOS Big Sur on it which would be a total game changer, allowing you to run Mac apps on it. We could very well see this in the future.

**Purple iPhone:** Who gives a fuck? Very niche.

All-in-all this is a very solid lineup and I am extremely bullish on the company moving forward, especially with the new top-tier iMacs and MacBooks coming later this year based on the much anticipated M1x Apple Silicon chip manufactured by TSMC."		11

seriously, growth is f'd for a long long time.

gv32c81	Look my portfolio is all GME as I sold the rest off months ago. However, I am not in support of jacking this thread off in a direction that’s only GME related. Why create an unnecessary conflict, Isn’t there enough as is? This will be my only post on the daily thread. Is there another locale on Reddit for all the gme shit blasts and cock tugging I have been enjoying for the past couple months. I don’t want people coming to my house talking about Jesus no matter how much they believe he will save them. I don’t wanna do that to people that aren’t interested in what I’m pushing either. Ya feel?		9
gv3ad0p	PLTR pleas fly again		11
gv3gh07	That’s fine while you wrinkle brains complete your DD on other infidel stocks. I will be wrapping my head with a GameStop flag, on my hands and knees doing my morning REEE’s to the Prophet Ryan Cohen praise be His name. When judgement day comes He will rise to CEO and a violent short squeeze will sodomize the market and all who invest in infidel. Tendies will be stripped from all who doubted Ryan Cohen praise be His name and you will all be forbidden from the Kingdom Of GameStop. Power to the players.		8

Given that we can not beat climate change/global warming due to the high pressure of industrial expansion in our global economy, i foresee that there will be a great migration north.

We're clamping down on low quality GME content, this is not a one stock sub.

guqcaqf	This thread will be destroyed Monday due to the GME megethread being taken away. Literally the worst decision that could be made and will do the exact opposite of what it wants to achieve		58

gupph81	PLTR has been upgraded, so expect it to dump more 😭		41
guqnngo	Personally, I think removing the GME Megathread is a BIG mistake, especially if it happens alongside  thinning out on GME posts all-together. I fully understand removing all the posts saying the same thing over-and-over, but if it is a popular topic (which GME obviously is), then that is what you have a megathread for, people wanting to discuss the same shit over-and-over		41
guqu9su	"Level headed GME owner here.

Anytime GME is mentioned on WSB, the spite and shitposts come.  The GME megathread was pretty much a safe space and the mods have killed it.   ( TBF, there were frequent visitors from here I presume... that come in to shitpost and troll and make fun of people losing money. ).  Somehow, the people that got in and got out of GME... just cant handle the fact that others still think there is value in that play.

So, yes... maybe they are reinforcing your stereotype by brigading... but the same can be said for how you have been ( and are currently ) behaving."		40

1. YTD: S&P 500 is up 11% (almost imposible to keep this pace on an annualized basis) 

2. MTD: S&P 500 is up 5%.  So this means that 46% of the year to date gains have been realized in the last 10 trading days (removed weekends and one holiday).  

Can I be wrong YES, however statistically speaking the pull back is increasingly more likely than an additional surge.

You have a giant influx on people that dont give a fuck about anything but GME but the mods loved the bump in numbers, all the press, so they let it happen. Now that its not trendy anymore and the daily ended,the apes are trashing the place on the way out like the scumbag tenants they are. The recent 180 on the bloomberg article just solidifies the mods ego comes before all else. Sad, I loved this sub.		6

\-Value (All boomer stocks up another 15-20%)

Then, as soon as growth starts to pick up again as their  values hit stupid lows, boomers will cash out of their value stocks at ATH, and correct the market, which will just drive growth stocks done lower."		11

gupv797	"Aso bums me out man. Even though the people I was arguing with about it a week or two ago had their puts become worthless, most of the open calls - including mine rip - will also expire worthless, and I think the problem with the play was the overuse of super short dated options instead of shares.

I sold my shares to get weeklies, but now I fully regret it. Even (at least one) bear agrees that the share price will eventually reach analyst targets in the high 30s/low 40s. I've been a bull for this stock since i found out about it and it hasn't disappointed me, but I feel like if it was capable of emotions then it would be disappointed in me.

guqc4v3	Wow! Even if you bought CLOV calls 30 mins ago, you could have gained 80% even after the run up of 14%		6
guqdnw7	So apparently CLOV has a 144% short float. Do these people ever learn?		7
guqdq6p	As poor boy, i choosed to buy CLOV		7
guqejdu	"Palantards, are you aware of your proud heritage?

Before buying PLTR stock was possible, people like us were called Flagellants. We would scourge our backs to imitate the suffering of Christ, and real bagholders among us may have been tough enough to hammer holes through their hands.

We would walk from village to
village and show our scars in exchange for a crust of bread and a pile of dry hay to sleep on. You can continue this proud tradition by showing someone at a bar your blown up portfolio in exchange for a drink."		7
guqemgn	There’s no fucking chance institutions can be this stupid to let CLOV short squeeze like GME. Like legit peak retardation if it does. Also market will break		7

Not 100% criticizing GME, even a daily thread is doable, IMO, but seeing GME plastered every other post does not diversify the fun. This sub was always about different pathways to riches"		8

gur05rw	I think AMC is pretty ass but 99.98 utilization is absolutely fucking ridiculous lmao		8
gur0cko	Well this devolved as quickly as I thought. Apparently never occurs to anyone that none of us are downvoting each other for having an opinion about GME? Look at the daily thread votes and upvote ratio to the GME thread votes and upvote ratio. THERE IS A HUGE MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN HAPPENING. STOP FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER, JUST LEAVE FOR A BIT.		7
gur0zpb	TSLA getting ready for take off		6
gur1re1	 just letting everyone know that AMC already squeezed. it is currently  trading for around \~40 a share if you add all the shares the CEO issued.  that's a jump from like \~4 to \~40. there's literally nowhere the stock  can go but down, so save your money and don't believe what people are  telling you. people here will make it seem like you're fighting the good  fight and manipulate your emotions so they can profit off of you. it's  honestly super fucked and anyone who bought AMC has my sympathy today		8

gupvmbv	Happy for everyone printing AMD calls today <3		6
gupwsei	"Might do a more comprehensive DD/Technical post with charts later, but looking at the market currently there's some things to note:  
- Both SPY (/ES) and QQQ (/NQ) have pulled away from their 21/50 day SMAs and are a large way away from their 200 day SMA. If you look at the past year, when these gaps have widened significantly we have had a pull back, a regression to the mean.  
- We are coming down off a massive peak in GEX (gamma exposure) which will probably unwind today given the monthly opex. Edit: Forgot to mention this has generally preceded (exacerbated) volatility in the market.  
- For the last three months, the back-end of the month has been choppy to the downside, post-monthly opex it would seem.  
We could very well grind higher for another week, but if the pattern follows I would expect us to see volatility to the downside towards the end of the month, and significant at that, not just chop. Thinking %7-10 pullback is possible here."		6

gulanjg	"Futures are pointing higher this morning, with small caps seeing the biggest gains. Russell 2000 up 0.9%. Nasdaq is 0.6% higher. Dow and S&P up 0.5%. That’s as of 0630.

It’s all about earnings today. This a day after Goldman, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo beat estimates. As I write this, Bank of America, PepsiCo, and UnitedHealth all came in and all beat on EPS and revenues. BlackRock also just reported and was the one outlier, beating on revenues but falling slightly short on EPS.

Still waiting on Charles Schwab, Citigroup, and U.S. Bancorp to round out the banks, but it looks like those ambitious earnings estimates were not misplaced.

Delta Air will report during market hours. That should be interesting where the reopening trend is concerned.

On the data front, we have retail sales and industrial production out this morning. And of course initial jobless claims seeing how it’s Thursday.

Bottom line: Things are looking pretty good for risk assets. Concerns about JNJ’s vaccine have faded. The reopening trend remains in force, at least in the U.S."		29

gumfq54	"I'm officially out for 90 days after being really stupid yesterday and taking 30k to 15k by FUD around tesla and constantly paperhanding stuff and switching calls/puts.

I am actually going to a therapist about my trading because it got so bad this last month.  Scheduled for 2 weeks from now.


I was up bigly (over 100k - I managed to be someone who had bought GME below 30).  Made money on PLUG, AAL, CCIV, apha, sndl (all the things.)

Then I bought into some other meme stocks (sndl, zom, ocgn, pltr) and this last month had me feeling like I needed to ""make it back"".

I had originally just made patient plays starting last March and that the reason I was up at all. Got lucky on some stuff but didn't fuck with day trades.

This last month I epically fucked myself feeling like I had to get back what I lost.  It became an addiction.  Constantly on Ameritrade, wsb, reading news around my stocks.  Not working, feeling sick, not eating, not working out, not spending time productive or relaxing at all.

As soon as insaw any red in my portfolio I'd freak out feeling like ""oh no I have to fix that."" Even though there was no emergency.  

The worst part is I effectively had 2 stupid days where if I had done nothing I still would have been green on the week. But between just those two days I day traded myself to 40k losses.  I consistently chose fear and emotion over the plan I had set out and couldn't control myself.

I constantly feel like I have to fix it and the only way to fix it is to trade. 

It was really fucking with all aspects of my life.  I'd be happy some days, and completely void of emotion others.  

Since I began trading I'm now down 10k overall.  

Hopefully I can work through my shit- this has been all I do every day for months now.  Stare at the chart.  Get emotional. Have no desire to do anything else.  Make bad emotional decisions after making good logical ones only to erase all gains made over weeks in a matter of minutes.


I consider myself lucky I didn't use the margin available and really fuck myself.  -10k suck, but I know others are worse off.

Maybe I'll never return to trading but I'll keep lurking and commenting.  I love this community, even the gay bears, for all the simultaneous support and shifting on people like me fir their terrible decisions."		30

gulnb88	"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Things are looking bright and sunny today.

* Companies are smashing earnings expectations across the board
* Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000.
* [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**. 

That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.

*[I try to predict the NASDAQ every day. See past prediction results and visualizations here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/yEPBC)*"		18

This is why you're bagholding ASO, it was undervalued at $23 and there was plenty of DD on here when it was at that price. If you lost money on ASO, it's not WSB's fault, you're just a retard."		8

(FNGU is a 3x-leveraged etn that tracks AAPL/AMZN/BIDU/BABA/FB/GOOG/NFLX/NVDA/TSLA/TWTR, it’s basically the ultra-chad TQQQ.)

I drew this up two days ago after that massive green day, a bullshit crayon drawing about what an inverted h&s *would* look like.

guluc1e	"Come here lads, and I'll tell ye a good campfire story.  It's the tale of the ASO 4/16 $35c holder that YOLO'ed it all.  Every day he watched as theta ate his portfolio.  As small beads of sweat dripped down his face, he stared at his screen.

Red.  Red.  Red.  His hysterical wife screamed at him, her bf whipped him over and over with his belt.  Each day his madness grew but he refused to sell.   Eventually he believed so much that he was right, he stole the bf's car, and drove as far as he could.  He parked it under a bridge and kept updating ""Yahoo Finance"" on his phone.  The car ran out of gas, and the bitter cold of the night took over.  He should have froze to death but no one found his body.  Just a cracked phone with 0 battery.

They say whenever you refuse to sell a weekly call option with no hope, if you feel a chill on your back it might be the hand of the ol' ASO call holder coming to feast on your soul."		8

Mr Powell: ""We are definitely happy with the results so far but we are still a long way to go from where we want to be before we can consider ending QE or raising rates. The reality is, unemployment is still above 0%, cancer is still around, and the sky is still blue. What we are looking for is negative unemployment, and what we mean by this is we want people to hold multiple jobs. We want cancer to be eliminated. And finally, we want the sky to become green. Once we achieve these goals, we will consider raising rates and possible taper QE."""		19

guinezy	"Story time.

When I was a kid back in 04 or 05, my dad asked me if I were to buy any one stonk, which would it be? I told him NVDA only because I loved playing video games and he had just gotten me a new Nvidia graphics card and I was stoked to be able to play Counter Strike with good FPS.

He said he'd get 500. In my head, I thought he got $500 worth. I completely forgot about it for about the last 15 or so years. Yesterday I called him and asked ""Hey remember when you bought $500 worth of Nvidia stock? It's probably worth like 40 grand now if you're still holding it!"" 

He said he was still holding, but made one correction. He didn't buy $500 worth, he bought 500 shares, and it's now worth over $300k.

Moral of the story? Stonks only go up."		19

Shorts and analysts are worried and putting negative articles everywhere and that signals shorts covering is coming too. We should be at the a beginning of a huge rally.		13

guiaak6	PLTR is trading right now at  40x+ forward revenue , COIN at $500 (130B mcap) trades at 20x + forward revenue and retards think PLTR is undervalued. COIN has crazy ass margin , 1.1B ebitda (which is the most important thing) just this quarter alone. PLTR keeps diluting their shares because of the SBC they are giving to their employees , so the shareholders are the ones paying their salary.		6

Owes her whole existence to TSLA. A great call, no doubt. Props on that. However, shes a one trick pony. She would be better off just buying FAANG plus M and TSLA than these shit hopium tech stonks shes been buying the last couple months.		6

guh2dwi	$NVCR. Just had stunning mid phase 3 trial results. It is a very unique cancer treatment using electrical fields. This trial was for Lung Cancer....which is the mother of all cancers volume wise. At 21k a month (list) that's a potential big money maker. Already part of first line treatment of a form of brain cancer. Plus...already a profitable company. 50% gain yesterday on the news and not cheap at 200$ per share. Still doing DD but will buy after letting it cool off. Christ...I have LC so should profit off treatment. Only seems fair.		6

 I am an ultimate retard who didn't take any of that 120 when I had it and put it away in anything safe.  I thought no way ALL of my tech positions can be bad, and after going to about 50k in March from 120k just made a bunch of really stupid emotional ""oh no I need to make it back quick"" option plays.    


Since then every second of every day all I think about is the money I lost and I feel desperate to make it back.   I basically get home from work and just sleep because I want to ignore the reality of what I did.

gucygua	For the smooth brains out there, it’s not the blood clotting that’s a big deal. It’s the FDA and CDC calling for a pause in administration of the JNJ vaccine. Also, it’s not how that impacts JNJ stock but rather vaccine roll out and hesitancy that’s concerning. Particularly for rural and poor areas that don’t have the refrigeration needed for the mRNA vaccine. It could slow down the “great reopening” which is priced for perfection.		16

I  just received a 200+page booklet in the mail as a TLRY/APHA shareholder  and thought I'd share some of the information with you guys.

\- The Aphria live audio meeting will take place on April 14th at 4:00pm EST at [www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021)

\- The Tilray meeting will take place on April 16th at 11:00am EST at [www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TLRY2021SM](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TLRY2021SM)

\-  shareholders of APHA will receive 0.8381 of a share of TLRY at the  merger (I wonder why Tilray's trading lower than Aphria right now? *edit:  oh, my broker shows tilray in USD but aphria in CAD so it's confusing,  they're trading at roughly .833 difference which is normal*)

\-  the two companies combined will create the world's largest global  cannabis company, with pro forma revenue of US$685m (C$874m) for the  last 12 mo. prior to the Dec.16/20 merger announcement.

\-  shareholders will vote on approvals for Tilray's charter amendment,  share issuance, advisory compensation, and adjournment proposals to  revise them;

\- increase the authorized capital stock of TLRY from 743,333,333 shares to 900,000,000 (890m class 2 common, 10m preferred)

There's  a lot of information to pore over in the booklet, these are just some  quick points. I am not a financial advisor, use this information at your  own peril."		14

gucw9ey	"Futures are flat as of 0630. This follows a blah day Monday when not much happened. That is all due to change with the Consumer Price Index reports for March, due out at 0830.

Expectations are for a 2.5% YoY print, up over 1.7% in February. The MoM number is anticipated at 0.5% (0.4% in Feb). This is a big data release because inflation, more than anything, is what will force the Fed to tighten interest rates. Once that happens it puts the Bull Market on borrowed time and eventually starts a Bear Market. That, at least, has been the pattern.

Powell and Co. have been making the rounds preemptively talking down inflation concerns. They’re saying any spike in inflation is due to be ‘transitory.’ Ultimately none of that may matter. Transitory or not, higher consumer prices (and higher markets, though they would never admit it) will force the Fed’s hand. So that’s why this is so important.

A good gauge of the market’s expectation of Fed policy is the Fed futures contract from CME Group. That and 5-year Treasury yields, which have been moving steadily higher. But that’s just the market expectations. The CPI print is what will move that. And if that number beats to the upside there is sure to be something resembling fear. That means selling of risk assets, like stocks.

Watch energy markets too. There are many factors affecting energy prices but inflation is one. To wit, crude is up about 1% this morning."		11

Nothing that I expect will rocket the stock price into the stratosphere, but there is an FDIC RPP update today and there's that senate meeting tomorrow which was based on the premise of ""china tech = bad, USA need tech"" and PLTR = USA tech. Probably not a coincidence Peter Thiel was dissing Google and others last week either.

gu943sw	I just bought more APHA to average way down. Fuk it.		9
gu94nhw	who has lost the most money on APHA?		10
gu94rxr	PLTR is doing the PLTR		9
gu957kj	When you buy APHA at the lowest it’s been the last 2 months and then it decides to drop casual 10% 🤦‍♂️		9

The end.  That's 195 red, for those playing along in the home game.

&#x200B;

With all the yammering JPOW does, I'm starting to think he might be short the markets.  Only reason he keeps opening his mouth and tanking them."		10
gu96x0s	Yeah ofc this happened I bought at opening PLTR 🤡		9
gu978qv	PLTR will take off it’s just a matter of time 🤷🏻‍♂️		9
gu97xiv	How much longer can you guys hold on to this short ladder attack theory. Maybe GME is just actually trading down?		9

gu9dlvo	MVIS u lil slut		9
gu9ewlq	LOL at the GME thread		10
gu9feio	I swear GME is going to be this cyclical thing from now on. Rises, gets shorted, Ryan Cohen coughs loudly or something, stock price jumps, shorts are forced to cover, GME hype comes back and then we rinse and repeat.		10

gu9ndq0	at first i was mad i sold my 550 shares of AMC at 11.75 when it went to 13.00 but now i look at it and man oh man im lucky		10
gu9nxw1	Imagine buying GME bags instead of Gucci bags.		9
gu9o47l	Thank you, TLRY. Very cool.		10

Algos are retards lmao"		10
gu9w0c6	Buying back into GME and TLRY on that “dip” last week was a bad idea. Down bigly		9
gu9w40y	I hope you guys bought AAPL calls when it was down...		8
gu9wv3p	Cathie sold a bunch of her BABA to buy more stocks like PLTR and OPEN which have fallen another 15% from when she bought lmao		10
gu9y0lx	finally poked my head into that daily GME thread.... big yikes		9
gu9ywqi	"Just learned that financial cuckholdry/financial domination is an actual fetish. Like you just give money to someone and get off on being abused financially. 

And just like that, I understand the GME thing.

Carry on apes. I don't fetish shame."		7
gu9yxy5	Big rip to all the APHA bag holders 2.0 for now.		10

gua6xx6	"A very close race between TLRY, APHA and GME for who can lose the most in a single day.

Edit: And GME has taken the lead!"		9
gua7f0k	Seriously considering quitting the stock market and just moving over 100% to trading the rule 4s. I don’t see the point continuing to play a rigged game, Wall Street hates the rule 4s because they can’t use daddy’s connections to give them an advantage. Not to mention GME kind of killed the market and this subreddit.		8
gua7hes	I said trying to catch a falling knife isn’t averaging down on the GME thread and so far have 42 downvotes		10
gua8n80	Us AAPL boys got a little too cocky last week so Tim is humbling us. $140 EoM 🍏🚀		8
gua9hv7	"What AMD did to me this morning sucked.

But at least I'm not an ape hoping for a dead meme"		10
guac9s3	You know what's funny. Its not like AMD won't crush its estimates or isn't also going into the server realm especially with Xilinx or isn't introducing laptop versions of its latest GPUs. Also, x86 does better than ARM in demanding compute applications.		10
guacfio	"I ordered a pack of bolts from Aliexpress which cost $2.50 and free shipping. 

The package was driven across half of china, loaded on a container ship, crossed the largest ocean, landed in Seattle and was put on a truck and driven across the USA to east coast, delivered to Postal Service and then a Postal worker delivered it to me.  

How the hell are they making any money here? It must have cost more to transport it right?"		9

gu8yjcs	"OPEN THE DOORS. 

I NEED TO BUY NEW BAGS."		8
gu8ylyx	Too much hype on PLTR. We all know what that means		8
gu8yoti	BB: Canana officially declares it good company, stock goes down. PLTR: finally doing good and palancheering. GME: held on for RC news and slightly disappointed but so volatile. Remains hopeful. TLRY: GUH. Was green on Friday. Should have ran wit my money. What a disappointment		8
gu8ysvd	Lol the guy that fucks married milfs truly is a retard. But so am I with these PLTR calls 🚀🚀		8

\-Continuing to buy every $CLNE June and September 13c anybody will sell me below my average cost

\-Sold a bunch of Devil's Gold at 61K, looking for something in the low 58's to buy it all back.

\-Configure my new R8 bought w/ $NUAN FD profits thanks to my man /u/Crosa13 for [putting the thought in my head last week in the most timely complaint ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkh463/daily_discussion_thread_for_april_05_2021/gth3sgt/?context=3)"		8

gu99oc9	"- Have AMA with financial analyst
- Hype up AMA expecting her to validate all conspiracy theories
- Pin AMA
- Analyst says another squeeze most likely won't happen
- Unpin AMA
- Go into damage control and spin her words to mean there won't be another squeeze AFTER ""the current squeeze that's happening now""
- Say she doesn't understand the DD that's out there
- Forget the AMA ever happened

guaj80a	Fuck I regret not shorting GME when it tapped 300 recently, easiest short in recent memory. My boy cleared 600k shorting the stonk		6
guajlfp	"Lmao I love this system. Morgan Stanley, who was a prime broker for Archegos, and was one, if not the first, of the PBs they did business with to offload their VIAC positions a couple of weeks back after the PBs agreed to unwind their collective positions back in a metered fashion. So, not only was MS involved in this from the get-go, but they now have come back and are offering new, down-graded price targets and analysis for VIAC, Credit Suisse, and Nomura - the latter two are some of the other PBs that Archegos did business with and subsequently lost their shirts on as a result of MS’s fuckery. 

It’s absolutely wild to me that they can still be capable of making these PT assessments while all the meanwhile having been involved in this nonsense from the beginning. Not to get all tin-foil hat or anything, but I’m sure they made a ton when they liquidated their position ahead of everyone else and probably decided to short it all the way down for good measure and extra tendies, too. Wild shit."		7

FDs only work in bullish scenarios.. and since nobody here is smart enough to buy financials or energy the only performing sectors everyone just buys sideways tech.. and expects it to moon. Get a time machine and go back to 2020. Imagine buying FDs in JP Morgan since January. Lmao. And you guys are buying freaking weed stocks. And Tesla		5

gtxe0rx	"Anyone saw this paper? 

 We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. **Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled**.

gtx4brd	I'm tired of seeing GME threads and memes tbh. This is Wall Street Bets not Gamestop bets :(		30
gtyhn88	Personally, I hope GME tanks. The GME crowd has taken something that was fun and exciting and has turned it into a cult. Just because you bought in at the ATH of 480, doesn't mean the stock is going to skyrocket to 1000+, especially when it already squeezed from $3.50 to 500.		32

gtyja72	"Asked a GMEtard for the absolute strongest ""DD"" they have since apparently they have an entire library of proof.  Linked me to like a 15k upvoted 10 page conspiracy thesis.

Entire thing is incoherent word salad and the ""facts"" it links to is shit like ""Melvin is still holding 6 million puts in February after the hearing!""  But get this, THEIR supplied link to the 13f shows that it was reported in February but like every fucking 13f out there it's based on calendar quarter data.  So they're saying Melvin lied about being short in February because they still had 6 million puts in *December*.  And no one there even realizes or understands this.

gtxjdnz	If anyone is new to trading and using RH, I’m not here to shame you.  The user interface is awesome and there are good things about it.  HOWEVER, having compared it live with TD Ameritrade and experiencing both, I have advice for RH users:  NEVER BUY OR SELL WITH MARKET ORDER.  They will front run your order and you will get a terrible fill.  That is how they make money and offer free trades.  Always use limit orders!  Or switch platforms		5

gtxpp4j	"If PLTR ends up red at end of day today it will have sealed its fate as the most resistant stock I have ever traded.

Of course I will buy more since I'm long term, but wow. just wow.

constant contracts across diverse sectors, most government. a company that prioritizes its disruptive product (Get it right before get it done), this is what companies like tesla/amazon/apple were doing back in the day before they exploded. mission centered disruptive companies that identify a specific need that others do not see or do not want to tackle and hone on it like a laser over 10+ years until it's complete.

I work in data analytics at a large health company. if PLTR accomplishes what they want (they are not there yet with their products IMO), it would significantly reduce the burden for our company and allow us access to patient insights at a 10x+ rate than current. its nuts. I deal with mounds of patient data, both identified and de-identified. there is so much fucking value in this aggregate data its mind boggling. data sources are device implant data, tracker data, clinical data, literature data. a massive treasure trove of insights. the data isn't perfect, but its improving and will continue to do so. patient insights that improve patient outcomes are contained in this massive sandbox of data, and we currently do not have the capability to extract it. we need companies like PLTR to help us. this. literally. will. save. lives.

I'm  sitting here looking into the future and see the direct value, its a no brainer. yet, the rest of the world is stuck in the 90s.

the stock movement defies all logic and reason. and the greedy suits and others that don't see this are blindsided by short terms profits. you. are. fucking. morons.

There are smart people that that got in and out at the right time, and even now people with low average cost per share are in a decent position, but the constant desperation to get people to buy into GME has really grown out of control.

Going to repost my story here since many of you are feeling beat down and I already see comments encouraging you to leave your positions (I also hold Cresco so no bias from me):

Time in the market will always be better than timing it. I held onto APHA through the short report, bad press, not so great financials for years and pressure to sell. At the time I bought at the peak in 2017. 

Saw my shares go down to $2 and didn’t know what to do with myself. Family pressure and friends pressuring to sell. Saying that saving is the way and that I was being irresponsible. So I doubled down on every drop I could. 

By November my average share price was now 6.45 instead of 17 or 18 (can’t remember exactly). Elections roll around (exactly why I was BUYING MORE) and then we saw the results. 3 long years of me constantly looking at losses and feeling like complete shit because I had told people about my investments and of course people will always remind you of your mistakes every time they can (don’t do what I did be quiet). 

February rolls around and those same friends didn’t even ask. They knew. They knew I was right then and they know I am right today. There is no better feeling in the world and your day will come young grasshopper. You need to buy more. That’s it. Is it shares? Not options? Buy more. Is this industry going anywhere else but up? No. I’m still holding those shares and didn’t sell at the “top” because that was t the top period. 

I am holding indefinitely because that’s how you build wealth. Not by hoping In and out of trades because somewhere along the way you’re gonna probably make a mistake. Few day traders are able to come up with (at peak) +300% return. The likelihood of you being able to do that? Not so likely. 

Hold your shares. Buy more. Period.

APHA April 16th 27C, April 23 19C and Jan 22 22C to the fucking moon!!! 🚀🚀🚀

gtuamrp	"All of the folks (""apes""...cringe) in GME think that by banding together they can take on the hedge funds.

gtuaxkn	Aint no bear but it is crazy how disconnected S&P is with real life. US talking sanctions or sending ships to black sea and we are just, yay ATH!		10
gtub7mi	"Some of these newer GME gang guys don't realize the whole point of this was to make money. Shoving it to the man was just a byproduct of making money. It always is on options for retail traders.

Just hope some of them don't get fucked too hard when this is all over. That being said autism is what autism does.

gtt537m	"I recently asked where I should “yolo” $2k into shares. I said I wouldn’t hold it against anybody. Was told ASO, and to buy now. 

Well, I changed my mind. You’re a cunt. I’m holding this against you. I’m certainly not going to take responsibility for my own actions. Especially spending money in blind faith from a strangers advice.

gtticw5	GME worked because it caught the market off guard. Now they're just making a killing selling options with insane premiums to retail and probably already made that money back and then some. If I'm wrong I'm wrong. But people scream its rigged while waiting for their shares to go to 1 million. Doesn't add up.		8

gttky9d	"Why 420 is important in Weed culture and why I’m exclusively in Cannabis stocks:

It’s okay to have beers and shoot. It’s okay to drink alcohol every day if you choose to. It’s ok to have employment with government agencies if you drink. You can serve in the military if you drink. You will have no problems with a security clearance if you drink.

None of the above is okay if you switch it to weed.

Things have to change and considering how Biden and Harris contributed to putting people in jail for a plant during their careers, their silence is unacceptable.

We sit here selfishly making money but what about the people that are locked up? The people that had their resumes tarnished forever? People of color and vulnerable people in general? When are we going to fight for them and raise our voices that this isn’t okay?

Are you fine with making money while knowing very well other people had their lives completely destroyed?

This President and Vice President need a wake up call.

Deals with Toyota and Honda mentioned in earnings call, but not officially announced yet. Patent sale. Facebook settlement. There is tremendous upside and huge growth coming. If you are “bag holding” it’s because you bought at the wrong time for the wrong reasons. If you are bag holding then support the stock instead of trashing it. You will get your money back and much, much more. I’ve never seen such criticism for a legit stock that is going to explode. I’m holding 5,000 shares that I bought before the meme BS.

Might even drop more tomorrow, but I AM buying the dips.

This weeks winner was selling a bunch of AMD 78 calls 4/9 expiry then buying 5 more AMD 81 4/16 calls when AMD dipped back below 81. My problem is for every one good option choice I have three bad ones. 42NIO 190Disney. 25 TLRY dragging me down. Instead of taking my 58% gains from my current AMD calls I will hold until 100+		7

3. Only play weeklies and 0dte if you know what's up. Otherwise stick to AT LEAST 1 month out expiry, or 2 month - for added safety (though reduced leverage, thus reduced potential gain and loss).
4. Buy ITM or ATM only. OTM options is why you always lose, even if you picked the direction right.
5. This is all just a game. If you're here to solve your financial problems - stop and talk to a professional financial advisor. This is 100% gambling.

How is it that PLTR volume is always so damn high, and yet price movement is so damn flat? I’m strongly “guessing” it’s because there’s an equal amount of buyers and sellers. Is it still the sell off of shares by long time holders, like company execs? The sentiment from retail investors is to buy and hold. So if it’s not retail doing the selling, and the sell offs aren’t predominantly still due to company execs and long time shareholder holders....and institutions haven’t bought in to a massive extent (to sell)...is the flat price movement due to options trading? 

And, Everytime I check, the volume of calls being bought far exceeds puts being bought...wouldn’t that make the price rise?


What am I missing. Be as much of an asshole as you want but can someone please lmk for real what the deal is? They had two massive new contracts recently. I’d expect it to go up a little and establish a new baseline, instead of going up slightly just to go back down slightly."		15

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the ask price of **87.40** which gives us a total value of:

It’s a quiet period on Wall Street that will probably not change until earnings season kicks off for real next week. In the meantime there is ample time for pontification.

Fed meeting minutes will be released at 1400. That’s the major data release for today. There is the potential that something could be unearthed here that will spook markets, especially if it’s a debate about inflation. Probably none of that will matter in the long term. The Fed will raise rates when it is compelled to do so. Regardless of what is said, that decision will likely be a reaction to market activity rather than a shift in the dot plot.

We are supposed to get first quarter earnings from Carnival (NYSE:CCL), the cruise line operator. “Supposed to” because there is some conflicting information on when this company reports. Kind of hard to figure out. But when we do get it, the numbers should shed light on how leisure travel is shaping up. 

Just got a pretty enthusiastic economic call from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Dimon has been right about these things before. He’s not a prognosticator by trade, which is one reason I tend to trust his forecasts more than most.

All else being equal there are reasons to believe the excess liquidity sloshing around the system will find its way to risk assets, specifically stocks, before too long. First quarter earnings could change that, but that will be the story for next week."		9

gtlr86n	RMO STILL RUNNING WTF		13
gtlroj0	"Seems some big announcement might be in for TSLA  , because

1.) Cathy Woods and Musk spoke yesterday

2.)  FSD Subscription announcement due

3.) TSLA SEC declaration due( for their non FIAT holdings)

4.) Whole day Ladder buy in 4K batches, 20K every 15 Minutes

5.) After a massive rally, one would expect Short borrowing like yesterday, ""0 Today""

All this points to a massive ""Delta"" , can be ARK/GS/Blackrock buying

Hold your breath, a massive uptrend in TSLA predicted this week!!!"		12

In it's purest form PLTR is very well made **data aggregation** platform. Forget all the AI bullshit, those people have no idea wtf are they talking about. Because those AI modules are build on top of the core platform kind of similar to plugin or extension.

Now I do believe that PLTR is the new Boeing. If you think for a second the current warfare is mostly digital and information. A good analyst/hacker with a laptop is more powerful than any battleship these days (those are just for shows). In the next 5 years, PLTR will be too important to fail for the US government just like BA before. It's very obvious lmao and I think Cathie sees it too."		10

\-Huge 5g space potential.. even a portion would be several times Nokia's current market cap

\-not a phone company anymore.. its an infrastructure company

\-recent deals in Austria, Brazil, Japan

\-Option chain constraining the price, gamma squeeze potential if rockets over the call walls at 5-7.

📷📷

I'm not a huge fan of VIAC, but without a doubt they are a very profitable company. Their current market cap is equivalent to their revenue. Their forward P/E is less than 10. By all common valuation metrics, they are very cheap. The ONLY REASON the stock price is so low is because of absolutely massive liquidations. That is it. We may never see a stock have this much stock liquidated in decades.

VIAC is incredibly cheap. Hop on board while it's still cheap. Easily could go back to 100 in the next month.

I except this one will continue to go up until then. Their stage 2 results showed a zero reoccurrence of breast cancer. Looks like it’s the real deal.

gtfti4p	"My take on what the share offering does. If you actually read and believe the DD about the new vision of the company and eccomerce and gaming then revenue up is good news and share offering is good news. They need money to fund that change and want to have a healthy cash balance in case of a massive deleveraging. 

If you just believe in the squeeze then this has to go through the SEC first. The government. Slow as hell. Meanwhile DFV will presumably exercise his contracts by 4/16 and the blackout period ends around the same time. Dont led FUD control you, think about all the variables at hand and make your own decision. I like the stock. Not financial advice. Pos 5 shares

Not only do we have another dip to buy (which many have asked for) but also, now GME can make up to $1b cash off the squeeze too. More money for the transformation and more reason for people to reinvest after the MOASS.

Why wouldn't they want a ticket? Especially when they may well have a catalyst locked and loaded. 🚀"		25

gth4yff	"Reddit asking what my thought are. Sure thing, Reddit, I'll let you know.  


I have gone through the five stages of Grief, a.k.a ""5 stages of Palantir"".  


1) Denial as in ""How could this soon-to-surpass-30$ stock go all the way to 20 and then take a dump every other day so it keeps teasing 23 and back down she goes!"".  


2) Anger as in ""YOU PIECE OF @#\~€¬¿?!!!!"" as market is green like grass and PLTR takes yet another dump. Or it goes up a tiny bit and insiders sell it into oblivion.  


3) Bargaining as in ""Ok, ok, I may be able to sell if it goes back to 26. Make it 25. Ok, I'll settle for 24. Is it too much 23.75 to ask?"".  


4) Depression as in ""I could have made so much money elsewhere and I'm stuck with this dumpster fire of a stock..."".  


5) Acceptance as in ""Palantir will do Palantir things. Stop looking at it funny every 3 minutes and eventually you'll break even and move along to pursue other venues"".  


I regret nothing...except not having sold today at 24.40. I fucking knew she would tease me and purple ball me back into low 22s :(

means most of the people looking to buy will probably buy asking price because they don't think the price will drop low enough to trigger their Limit Buys

Man, I loved checking in on WSB when it was low key, under 250k subs. It made me very rich and very poor many times. Most times I didn’t cash out near the top.
Ugh one time I showed my coworkers making 100k in a week, and 30k in a day.
Literally lost all 100k real quick, but now I’ve rallied up basically my whole workplace on GME.
I’ve changed two of my coworker friends’ lives.

Back when they missed out on me telling them about FCEL at .50, they listened to me for GME at $15.
One of the lowest paid employees is up 300%+ on her fcel, it’s hilarious, she’s a better trader than all the other car salesmen.

gswglu9	"Futures are flat as of 0600. Dow, S&P, Russell 2000 all hovering around their close from yesterday. Tech stocks are trying to get off the ground, with the Nasdaq up 0.3%. Bond yields are steady as well.

There just isn’t all that much to move the market. (By the way, notice how quickly we’ve already moved on from Archegos?) Earnings season doesn’t kick off for another couple of weeks and there just don’t seem to be any catalysts until then.

We do have the ADP jobs numbers for March, scheduled for release before the open. 550,000 new jobs are expected. This usually doesn’t move things very much unless there’s major deviation from what’s anticipated.

That leaves us with today’s infrastructure announcement by the Biden administration. Lots of drama around this already, as can be expected from an incoming administration’s first major piece of legislation (not to mentioned the poisoned political climate we find ourselves in).

But details of these plans have (been) leaked out already and frankly they don’t look particularly draconian where tax policy is concerned: Corporate taxes will be raised from 21% to 28%. That’s still well below the 35% level that existed prior to Trump’s tax cuts.

That’s it. Nothing about income taxes on individuals, wealthy or otherwise. Some talk about discouraging tax havens for corporations that I’m sure will be well heeded but ultimately go nowhere.

So unless the Biden administration is hiding its true intentions with this infrastructure bill, there doesn’t seem to be any reason for concern. There could of course be further policy announcements forthcoming. Maybe that’s what the market is worried about. But even then, the Democrats’ majority in the Senate is razor thin.

In the end this whole infrastructure bill may just end up being more PR than anything else. Certainly wouldn’t be the first time."		25

gsxj9fg	While the boomers think the fact that PLTR hides its advantage is bearish, I think their secrecy is bullish.  If Karp knows hes got a golden goose, why would he go around flaunting it.  However, if it really wasn't all that great, wouldn't he wanna try to get people into it?  IDK, I'm a palantard, but I think this stock has a bright future in the long term		6

gsscltv	"The big story is still Archegos Capital. Yesterday I said this didn’t look like an LTCM-type of systemic event. This morning that view appears vindicated. 

Couple of reasons for this. For one, financial stocks would be on the front line of any massive unwind as many of these banks were/are counterparties not only to Archegos, but to its counterparties. But that fallout appears limited to Nomura and Credit Suisse. The XLF (ETF that tracks financials) is up 0.7% in the pre-market. 

Then you have the stocks that were at the center of Archegos’ implosion (or cover images for the story, at least): Viacom and Discovery. Both saw extensive selling from Friday through yesterday but are up in the pre-market today: VIAC by about 6%, DISCA by 1.5%. (Yeah there are a bunch of Chinese internet stocks that also figured into this story, but they have other issues affecting them).

Finally, you have the news coverage of the story. These have moved on from what you would call ‘first day’ news pieces to post-mortem type of things. A quick sample of the headlines this morning:

* “How Archegos’ $20 billion decision led to banks’ share prices tumbling”: CNBC;

* “What is Archegos and how did it rattle the stock market?” WSJ;

* “Archegos Capital blowup: What investors need to know”: Bloomberg;

* “Goldman U-turn on Hwang put bank at nexus of margin call”: Bloomberg;

Knowing a thing or two about newsrooms (from experience), I can tell you there is no way anybody would have time or interest to pursue projects like this if the bigger story about Archegos was still developing.  

Things could certainly still (d)evolve from here. There may be pockets of information about Archegos that could cause fear in the broader market. But for all intents and purposes, the story would appear to be done. In a few weeks you may have already forgotten about it.

Back to today’s markets: Ten-year yields have quietly climbed north of 1.7%. Maybe the inflation story will surface again"		10

My portfolio is down around 16% since I started investing in earnest this year, (after first GME boom) but I got an e-mail from Sofi, a broker I forgot I ever used, reminding me about an annual meeting for Carvana, a company it looks like I invested $10 in a year ago, likely to take advantage of some promo Sofi was running at the time. Well, like me Carvana is down about 20% for the month, but that $10 of stock has still grown 425% for the year. Rough times we're in, but patience, AND forgetfulness, pays off.		9

gsaboqe	"Heads up to anyone transferring out of RH. I started the process on the 15th. I left $75 in my account so that they would use that as the transfer fee. My portfolio arrived in my Fidelity account yesterday (March 25) and they then took $75 out of my Fidelity account. So they charge your brokerage that you transfer to. Also the shares that they sent over are “Margin”. Regardless if you had a cash account. So be sure to call your new firm and have them convert that from margin.

The next issue I’ve had is that Robinhood still shows the money I had in there for them to transfer the shares. Guess what, I can’t transfer the money to my bank because when you transfer your portfolio, they deactivate your account. So instead of paying $75 for the transfer, I’m now out $150. 

TL;DR-When transferring from RH, have the $75 in your new brokerage account and go ahead and withdraw your cash balance before you start the transfer. 

Maybe this will help someone."		12

gsb0ea5	"I know I could be wrong but I really dont see GME ever touching 300 again. Maybe not even 250. It is completely different to the situation in January and if you dont realize or believe the HF reorganized their positions during the trade halt fiasco idk what to tell you. The crazy price action lately is most likely due to abusing the insane IV on options contracts. Retail ""holding"" doesnt do shit to the share price. There are huge players moving huge sums of money who are rolling in the profits from the volatility. 

Tldr : Think for yourself and take profit when you want"		16
gsb25my	I swear this sub became GME only even though theirs a GME megathread jesus christ any other ticker is instantly downvoted so fast.. It can be a strong good company and yet if it's not GME 👎 instantly ... C'mon y'all..  this is stock related sub not strictly GME.		12

Then I see a shit stock like GME skyrocket, fall and skyrocket all over again. If I would have bought and sold conservatively over the past few months I would have been better off blindly following apes. It frustrates the shit out of me! The whole fricken world is upside down... Rant over... Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.		11

Nope. You are predictable. Beautifully predictable.

Now buy GME, and enter the simian zone. The belief is apes can crush the ‘normal’. Apes are simple, stubborn and loyal. The ‘nightmare of young, dumb investors’ - remember that?

The algorithms are creating a floating sell wall that always sits about 4 cents higher than the last executed price.  I have been watching the same algorithm do this for weeks and it is clearly manipulation per the definition on the SEC website.   I encourage other RKT investors to do the same and hopefully they will get to the bottom of it.

I also sent a request to RKT investor relations to see if they can do anything about it.

To the party that has been doing this, I hope to see you thrown in jail and/or sued by all of us soon."		8

Ok, so we all know that some quarter mile long ship has been stuck in the Suez Canal since Tuesday.

The Suez Canal connects the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean via The Red Sea. As much as 30% of the world's shipping container freight typically passes through the Suez Canal every day. That is a shit ton of tonnes.

There is some money to be made but my thesis is the worlds shipping lines will see inflated freight contract prices in the short term if these ships have to start sailing around the Cape of Good Hope (that is the southern tip of Africa). [Currently 200 ships are backed up waiting for passage through the canal](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/suez-canal-ship-blocked-traffic-jam_n_605de99fc5b65d1c2814f17f) which is holding up about $400M in goods per hour.

[NAT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NAT?p=NAT) \- **Nordic American Tankers Limited**

$3.85/share, $580M cap

The CEO recent said [""A longer voyage will lock up more shipping capacity, reducing the effective number of voyages the world fleet can perform over a period. This means reduced availability of shipping capacity, which in turn would imply higher freight rates. ""](https://www.nat.bm/nordic-american-tankers-ltd-nyse-nat-comments-on-the-current-blocking-of-the-suez-canal/) and one of the directors just [bought 50.000 shares](https://www.nat.bm/nordic-american-tankers-ltd-nyse-nat-purchase-of-shares-by-nat-board-member-alexander-hansson-3/) today.

New CEO, New business plan. The price target got upgraded by like everyone to $70-$75.

But, every time it tries to break out, it gets dragged down by nasdaq crashing. All these tech stocks mooned this year, but Intel didn't. Now all these tech stocks are inevitably crashing, and it's dragging down INTC, even though it never mooned. 

It's like half tech stock, half boomer stock, and it's just getting tossed around like a $2 whore.

Some days she's nice to you, flirts a little, laughs at your silly jokes and your Wendy's uniform. You are on cloud nine, she LIKES you, this is IT

Then the next day she is cold. She barely speaks to you. She ignores your 500 texts. Rumor has it she might be dating another dude. Despair sets in.

The next day she smiles at you and you are once again all in.

Then one day she cuts off your dick, and throws it out the window of a speeding Lambo"		11

1. What makes GME different from Circuit City, Blockbuster, and Radioshack?
2. What unique features can GME offer have that Amazon, Epic Store, Xbox Store, GoG, Steam Library, etc., cannot?
3. Why is GME suddenly reddit's darling when for many years it was ridiculed and trolled by 4chan and reddit alike, for a) shitty trade-in value, b) association with Chris-chan and CTRL-ALT-DEL (loss comic), and c) Literal Hot Topic tier mall garbage retail? Remember Battletoad?
4. Why are we getting different narrative each day and week? At one point GME was to stuff the Wall St. rich hedgies, yet at the same time you cheer for Chamath, Elon, and Cuban. Why do you at one point claim that it's to draw exorbitant price from the hedgies (10k per share) but now do you say it's a long-term investment?
5. If GME is a long-term investment, why do you think it wouldn't follow Macy's, JC Penney's, or even Sear's 10 year stock price?
6. If you really like the stock and that's the only reason for buy and hold, why do you come with all sorts of QANON tier TA, DD, and mother of all short squeeze theorem to justify bagholding? Do you agree that your emotional attachment is not good enough?"		21

A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.

Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”

 Considering APHA is currently at $18.12, TLRY at $23.22, shouldn't everyone just buy APHA instead of TLRY since 83% of $23.22 is $19.27, so you basically get a discount by just stocking up on APHA if you're longer holding it.

gs1a5z6	We all knew it would happen, the GME goal post has been and always will be on wheels so it can be easily moved further and further until the end of time.		10

gs1kdq9	I bought 65 calls at 0.05 each for 35c 4/16 on BFLY for the earnings on the 29th. If it prints and soars to $25+, if not hopefully $30+ I'll be at break even. Did the math and this $360 investment could be worth a smooth $9,000+ . Pray for me boys. I need a W to stay in the game.		9
gs1kzbg	Intel is a shit company compared to AMD		11
gs1ms6l	i think the AMC ride is up.		11
gs1n0on	As my TA predicted yesterday, AAPL continued it's breakout into the inverted, half-lego, redbull can on the weekly. If AAPL can break the $123.50 goldfish line and maintain the big batman monthly we may see further moves into squirtle territory. Still very bullish on this stock get in while you can. Will post further TA throughout the week.		10

People get into GME early from DFV's DD and pocket millions during the first run-up.

GME gets national/world-wide media attention so people flock to the stock.

HF infiltrate /r/wsb impersonating retail investors and going on a ""the squeeze has not squozen"" campaign.

GME has another ride up near 300 due to a high number of existing naked calls that expired 3/12

GME bleeds from 295 to 200 in a week but the DD points at quad witch 3/19 as a catalyst. GME ends in red again.

Q4 Earnings is the next catalyst. GME drops 18%.

Bagholders insist that fellow apes must HODL in order to reach valhalla.

Just want to get clarification, options isn't something I mess with. Here is my plan.

1. Buy a August 20, $27 call for $3. 
2. When the stock finally starts doing something, I'll purchase the 100 shares.
3. Sell when I think it's peaked or hold on for a long time

If I don't get past step 1, the most money I can possibly lose is $300, is that right?"		9

Assuming it’s real (which it most likely is given the influx of new users), all I can say for new investors is this;

Never gamble with money you can’t afford to lose or that you immediately need to pay important bills. I don’t care if you want to stick it to the man or if you read hundreds of DDs explaining stonks go up, you should always *always* only invest the money you don’t need to live a stable life. I love looking at the loss porn here as much as the next retard, but it kills my boner when it comes at your expense in a major life altering way. 

If you’re getting this message and you’re already in that situation, then my message is this; money comes and goes. You’ll get through this. I started my adult life in debt and grew it to 115k+ (not counting interest payments, re-maxing out credit cards, etc). I was financially retarded and racked that up with student loans, credit cards, private loan and auto loan. I’ve paid off 85k of that, with only about 17k coming from profits in the market.  It sucks and I spent most of my past 6 years chipping away at it. But things got better. Things will get better for you too."		8

If you're still holding GME - you do you, but if the hedgies couldn't make money off of it at this point, you wouldn't be allowed to trade it.

I wake up in my GameStop-branded bed and pull back the curtains to another beautiful day. The surface of the moon is sparkling with the glistening glow of fresh tendies that rained overnight.

I turn on the TV to check the value of the GMED (GameStop Dollar, the new global currency after the Great Squeeze of 2021) and find it has risen 1% overnight -- $12055 per share, not bad. The ongoing court case against the market manipulators looks like it will soon resolve in our favour; it's frustrating it has taken this long, but nobody said justice was quick.

After finishing a delicious bowl of Nintendo Cereal System, which was brought back into GameStop shelves in 2029 to celebrate its 40th anniversary, I put on my shoes and coat to head to work.

As I open my garage, I am greeted by my Lambo, custom plate ""GME21"", its yellow paint glimmering in the light. No matter how many times I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful machine, it somehow never gets old. I hope it never does.

Feeling in a particularly good mood, I am driven to work with the power of Blackberry's latest EV technology along the freshly constructed moon highway to the sea of tranquility, where my workplace, GameStop MegaTower #4 is located. After their market cap reached $1 trillion, it didn't take long for GameStop to expand into every industry imaginable -- and some that were even beyond our imagination. 

After a fulfilling morning trading $GME and GMED on the integalactic market, I decide to take the hyperloop to my favourite lunar restaurant for lunch. Jim Cramer takes my order, looking a little dishevelled but otherwise relieved to have found a job somewhere to help pay off his debts. I exchange 0.00019 $GME for a plate of tendies with ketchup. It was delicious.

I decide to take the afternoon off from work, as working is not a necessity for those who had diamond hands pre-squeeze. I stop off at GameStop on the way home to pick up the PS6 Slim and Nintendo Switch 2 XL, which I look forward to playing in the evening.

As I sit in my living room enjoying my games, I sit back and wonder how life would have been so much different if I hadn't held with diamond hands. Through dips and spikes. What WallStreetBets and the internet community managed to pull off was the greatest wealth transfer in history, and life was never the same again. I shudder at the thought of a world where I had taken profits at $1,000 -- I would have enjoyed a nice holiday, sure, but those pleasures come-and-go. Only by holding were we able to change the world forever, to change the world into a fairer and brighter place.

That night, I bow to my framed photograph of /u/deepfuckingvalue before falling asleep, a soft smile on my face, optimistic and excited for what awaits me tomorrow."		19

Something to keep watching. Big time ATH. Money flow index shows its overbought. MACD is still climbing vertically. Wish I got in this morning, but am fearful this isn’t going to keep climbing tomorrow. Eyes will be on its movement though."		12

If you went heavily into a stock in one purchase and didn’t slowly build your position while monitoring the direction of the stonk...well you’re retarded but here is my tip for you.

grt2rzd	ARKX launches in 1 week so there could be a run up on space stocks in anticipation, GSAT is very undervalued right now given all the good news they’ve had lately with their Qualcomm and Nokia deals and they have potential to be included in ARKX, there’s also really high open interest on out of the money call options like the 7/16 $4 call which implies that a lot of people think GSAT has the potential to go that high in the next few months. I personally have a lot of calls and bullish spreads on GSAT and think that we could go as high as $2.40 this week or next assuming GSAT isn’t included in ARKX. If it is included, I think that the stock will get even more attention and go much higher. If you want some safe plays, look at the July strike calls around $2-4 but if you want more of a YOLO that could 4-5x in the next week or two, look at the 4/16 $3 calls for $.05 each. Good luck everyone and please feel free to let me know if you have something to add, disagree with anything I said, or would like to share your current position on GSAT.

I've blown up several accounts in the past year, I touched as high as $65K from a $1200 initial investment during the first GME run up cashing out/selling at around $16K only to lose 96% of it all within a month chasing the losses from doubling down over and over. My problem is that I'm just too impatient which is why my accounts were always over 95% in leveraged options which wasnt healthy. 

Taking extra dosages of Hopium and Copium everyday thinking ""okay, I bought the TSLA dip this is my chance to make a comeback"" only for it to literally die re before my eyes in pre-market not even giving me a chance to get out take any profit I had and lose a significant amount of that investment. (as an example). 

The point I am trying to make here is that, the knowledge to know how to trade stocks/options is there permanently for me so walking away for a few months, shit even a year or two isn't so bad to refocus on the other things in life that did make me happy. Waking up at 4am to check pre-market after spending an hour looking at futures like any of it mattered ruined my sleep and having no one outside of this sub to really to about it was also a depressing thing. 

Anyways, for this who still want to be in this casino, I wish you the best of luck. Mines simply ran out and I don't want to be giving BJ's behind an Arby's just to scrap up enough funds to buy a damn weekly FD only to have that go to zero in a matter of minutes of market opening/closing. I'll still lurk here and there as I ween myself off this sub altogether for a while but I hope someday I can come back being in a better position in life to be able to afford to lose this kind of money and not be affected mentally from it. For now, its just not a good time. I'm 27 for reference, so I have time always make some type of comeback and who knows maybe even have a lambo someday. That's all for now since I need to get back to work but Godspeed Autists, Good luck GME ape gang and anyone else who managed to read this post. 

Sincerely, your boy

grsqqa4	Predictions on TSLA @ open and close today? 695, 750 here		7
grsr9oe	ARKX launches in 1 week so there could be a run up on space stocks in anticipation, GSAT is very undervalued right now given all the good news they’ve had lately with their Qualcomm and Nokia deals and they have potential to be included in ARKX, there’s also really high open interest on out of the money call options like the 7/16 $4 call which implies that a lot of people think GSAT has the potential to go that high in the next few months. I personally have a lot of calls and bullish spreads on GSAT and think that we could go as high as $2.40 this week or next assuming GSAT isn’t included in ARKX. If it is included, I think that the stock will get even more attention and go much higher. If you want some safe plays, look at the July strike calls around $2-4 but if you want more of a YOLO that could 4-5x in the next week or two, look at the 4/16 $3 calls for $.05 each. Good luck everyone and please feel free to let me know if you have something to add, disagree with anything I said, or would like to share your current position on GSAT.		6

Mass reports on accounts posting DD to get them suspended

Shills are fighting back!!

Moderators and respected users from the GeEmEe sub reddit that provide the people with good due diligence are being targeted en mass with account claims, to the point that Reddit suspends their accounts. If this is not a sign that they are still more then afraid of the retail side shoot me. It looks like that, in a last ditch effort, next to mass downvoting, they are now also directly targeting those who are informing the public. Taking away freedom of speech, combined with creating media silences when they want to and negative media sentiment when they need to, this is really going of the charts and they are fully living up to Cramer’s acknowledgement that, when you are wrong, do everything in your power to hide that.

grhkesx	I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental AAPL futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative industry. After watching a video about Steve Jobs and his monopoly on sheeple, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another CEO. I did some research and found out many Wall Street  forecasters expected this year's AAPL yield would be far greater than the past, due to deteriorating public conditions in COVID areas and a warmer-than-average market. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the AAPL bubble burst on February 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families having any money or jobs, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of March 15th, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive treasury yield growth, scheduled for early August, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in April, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the yields in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 2% each, causing the price-per-call of my AAPL to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per call. I am ruined.		14

And the narrative was rotation out of tech and into value/recovery stocks. Now that bond yields are 1.726%, the QQQ is green and DOW is red. So either they don't matter at all, or they do matter but only on days the market randomly decides they matter.		13

grhzwy3	Things I'm learning lately: UVXY sucks.  PSTH will never announce anything. Bonds and yields and old people are better off dead.  GME cult would drink poison Kool Aid in South America if told.  Apple is the shittiest fruit. Tech is  no longer relevant in this high tech world. There is a shortage of chips except at Zion Williamson's house. Unsupervised playing with Legos on a Peloton treadmill is bearish.  We are all fucked eventually.  What did I miss?		11

The AMC titan just caught the short titan off guard with a late push to $14. I think the short titans will have the available borrow to push it down and keep it there.

gr8ynwu	Who cares what PLTR is doing right now? It's a long play. Karp seems Musk-esque in his attitude to stock prices and investors, so he's gonna say things from time to time that freak people out; if you believe in the company then that makes it great for buying the dips: just get your buy button ready any time you see he's going in front of the public. Besides, if you bought in you must know what they do and how well they're positioned over the long term. Let it do it's thing and all will be well in the end.		12

-We retest 20-22 and double bottom

-We go sub 20. 

My bet is we don't make a double bottom but instead a cup and handle, bouncing off 23-24 range this week and uppies for next week.

Positions: 2k shares

3/19 26.5p (bought when we were at 27)

If you are genuinely selling large amounts of shares, you would do it gently and carefully. This sort of dumping is for one reason Ans one reason alone. 

They are betting people will get tired, and drop the shares.

If you do this, they can still win.

Don’t be a retarded fuck who listens to these clowns with 1-2 shares who NEEDS it to go to 1k+ before they can cash in. Take your profits, hold cash, buy back when it’s steady. I sold, at 271 yesterday, because I could see it going down. Am I buying back in? Absolutely when the bleeding has stopped. Would I gain anything by holding? Absolutely fucking not. Instead of holding 20 shares I might be able to hold 40 next time because I sold out early with a profit. And maybe when it moons, I might be holding 40 shares instead of the 20 I had.		37

Listen, Yahoo! and MarketWatch already got caught posting about the GME drop on Wednesday before it even happened.

Volume for GME right now is not even at half of the daily average.

And absolutely no news or reason has come out to change the fundamental value of GME or completely change the potential for a short squeeze.

They can force the price down all they want. You can troll as much as you want in the comments. That isn’t going to change reality or our resolve."		30

I feel like the opinion of it basically changes as soon as we hit a few bad days or that it doesn’t moon right away. We’re all aware its volatile as hell and that it could go back down very low. If anything, it going lower is a good thing and will give the chance for true diamond hands to buy in or buy more. I bought at 117, didn’t sell at 40 and didn’t sell at 300, why would I leave now, it’s money I can afford to lose either way.		34

Remember why you bought into this stock.

Has anything changed that originally got you in? Prices going down? Nobody questioned the price going up when the entire market was going down last week. But now that its doing the inverse it's like the roof is on fire. Remember that this is a once in a lifetime event. The playbook is thrown out. Nothing makes sense. The only thing that's clear is what got you into this story.

Believe in Cohen.

gr4jwgi	"Thought about setting up a throwaway for this as I'm sure I will get downvoted to oblivion but oh well.

I've been part of the GME movement since January getting caught in the hype buying in multiple times until I averaged out at $275. Not a massive problem as all I was seeing was green and when we hit $450 I'd doubled my money (If I sold). Like all the other ""apes"" I did not sell and held through the massive short attacks and restricted trading I thought it was a temporary dip. I held all my shares all the way back down to $40 to see them go all the way back up to $350 this time around, not learning my lesson from last time, I ended up averaging up from $275 to $330 just before the next short attack hit.

Since then all I've seen is DD to tell me I'm clever and to keep on holding, I've had multiple chances to sell with only a 10% loss but today I finally stopped believing I've sold for a massive 46% loss because I no longer believe that this is going where we want it to.

The problem with this stock now its become a cult movement every bad word said is seen as a personal attack. Im lucky enough that although pissed off a 46% loss isn't going to financially ruin me but others are holding onto this stock blindly following every piece of ""DD"".

Some people are going to loose a lot of money, I know the FOMO I've been through it enough times but ask yourselves are you willing to loose possibly 90%+ of what you essentially gambling with? If not cut your losses while you still can, remember you're up against billion dollar hedge funds here, you don't even exist of their radar."		20

Of course, not saying it would ever do that... or could ever do that... or is in the process of doing that right now. That would be a silly thing to say, looking at the current price of the stock and its price all throughout last week, to say the stock might not be very very high and moving upwards."		16
gr4i8pe	I believe the GME squeeze theory, but I guess this second wave wasn't around during the first. Sentiment in the thread is EXACTLY the same as it was before it dropped $40. This time I took grands in profit though. I'll buy back in when it flatlines next week!		19

Lesson 3. Do your own DD and don't be part of an echochamber. I'm not saying it is all over with GME, not at all, but i have learned and experienced it in a short time. 

Thanks for this wonderfull reddit forum guys. I am abosolutly enjoying the thrill. The shills. The preachers and realistic eyes on GME. It was just a little expensive thusfar haha"		13

gr461kx	“So unbothered by this GME dip and thankful for the cheap shares that I have to let strangers online know how unbothered I am and that I’m buying cheap shares (actually not tho, just have to spin this drop in share price into a good situation to feed my hunger for confirmation bias). This drop is a good sign since it shows that the hedgies are getting desperate, so we’re getting close to $500,000 per GME share even though short interest is at 28%, which is the hedgies lying since they’re now shorting ETFs, because multi-billion dollar hedge funds have nothing to do but pay 100% attention to a brick and mortar short position.”		9

I'm a poor ass ape with a small ass stake in GME. But what I do have is a fucking abundance of hair that some other ape could use better than me. My hair is long as shit cos I like to bang my ape brain against walls at rock shows.

If successful I will repost the video as a main thread for you to relish my slap head.

I've been in it since it was sub $10 and have taken some profits. Nothing HUGE because I wanted to see where it was going, but I'm kind of liking how things are looking pre-tlry merger. 

I know APHA likely doesn't NEED tlry from the way things look...but hear me out. I know big tobacco has been planning for this day to come. If these small companies want to survive and control market share once weed is legalized...they're really going to need as much capital and credit as they can get their hands on.

I foresee Apple-like lawsuits about everything from packaging to manufacturing processes to biological IP for cultivation and even plant genetics. The corn industry and tobacco are two prime examples of how big subsidized corps can drive out smaller companies.

This is one of the main reasons I'm personally interested in seeing the merger go through. A company like SNDL will get all the press right now...but the bigger companies or companies preparing to battle once they get into the legal market are the ones I can see making it."		29

AMC lost 4.4 billion dollars over the past year. In a normal year they only turn 100mm profit. It will take them 44 years of normal operations to reverse this loss. Not to mention they've accumulated 10 billion in debt over the past 5 years. They have about a 16billion EV with Earnings of 100mm per year (hopefully). that is 160 P/E with 0 growth.. 

do not be caught holding this bag!!!! If you think there is something wrong with my assumptions please let me know!!"		21

gqzzajv	GME has a shot of surviving and becoming a profitable and growth related company, thats what makes it the ultimate short squeeze.  AMC is dead meat - no ones gonna go buy popcorn and get soda on their shoes at some shitty AMC, and AMC streaming is a pipedream.		19

Doubling down on short positions. Now we have a company that has strategically positioned itself to emerge stronger. People say this isn’t the same as GME, maybe. It’s obviously not the same business. But the comeback kid story is a tale as old as time.		16

I feel confident that this will break 20 maybe not by the end of today but next week but in the near future. Hopefully, 50 is a number we can see as well?"		16
